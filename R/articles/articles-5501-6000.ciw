AB Aim We analysed spatial datasets of abundance across the entirety, or near entirety, of the geographical ranges of 134 tree species to test macroecological hypotheses concerning the distribution of abundance across geographical ranges.
   Location Our abundance estimates came via the USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis Eastwide Database, which contains data for 134 eastern North American tree species.
   Methods We extracted measures of range size and the spatial location of abundance relative to position in the range for each species to test four hypotheses: (a) species occur in low abundance throughout most of their geographical range; (b) there is a positive interspecific relationship between abundance and range size; (c) species are more abundant in the centre of their range; and (d) there is a bimodal distribution of spatial autocorrelation in abundance across a species range.
   Results Our results demonstrate that (a) most species (85%) are abundant somewhere in their geographical range; (b) species achieving relatively high abundance tend to have larger range sizes; (c) the widely held assumption that species exhibit an 'abundant-centre distribution' is not well supported for the majority of species; we suggest 'abundant-core' as a more suitable term; and (d) there is no evidence of a bimodal distribution of spatial autocorrelation in abundance.
   Main Conclusions For many tree species, high abundance can be achieved at any position in the range, though suitable sites are found with less frequency towards range edges. Competitive relationships may be involved in the distribution of abundance across tree ranges and species with larger ranges (and possibly broader niches) may be affected more by biotic interactions than smaller ranging species.

AB 1. Predation plays an integral role in many community interactions, with the number of predators and the rate at which they consume prey (i.e. their functional response) determining interaction strengths. Owing to the difficulty of directly observing predation events, attempts to determine the functional response of predators in natural systems are limited. Determining the forms that predator functional responses take in complex systems is important in advancing understanding of community interactions.
   2. Prey survival has a direct relationship to the functional response of their predators. We employed this relationship to estimate the functional response for bald eagle Haliaeetus leucocepalus predation of Canada goose Branta canadensis nests. We compared models that incorporated eagle abundance, nest abundance and alternative prey presence to determine the form of the functional response that best predicted intra-annual variation in survival of goose nests.
   3. Eagle abundance, nest abundance and the availability of alternative prey were all related to predation rates of goose nests by eagles. There was a sigmoidal relationship between predation rate and prey abundance and prey switching occurred when alternative prey was present. In addition, predation by individual eagles increased as eagle abundance increased.
   4. A complex set of interactions among the three species examined in this study determined survival rates of goose nests. Results show that eagle predation had both prey- and predator-dependent components with no support for ratio dependence. In addition, indirect interactions resulting from the availability of alternative prey had an important role in mediating the rate at which eagles depredated nests. As a result, much of the within-season variation in nest survival was due to changing availability of alternative prey consumed by eagles.
   5. Empirical relationships drawn from ecological theory can be directly integrated into the estimation process to determine the mechanisms responsible for variation in observed survival rates. The relationship between predator functional response and prey survival offers a flexible and robust method to advance our understanding of predator-prey interactions in many complex natural systems where prey populations are marked and regularly visited.

AB 1 Our earlier meta-analysis of the effects of abiotic stress on the outcome of plant-plant interactions, suggested that the magnitude of the net effect provided by neighbours, whether positive or negative, was not higher under high abiotic stress conditions. This result, which does not support predictions of the stress-gradient hypothesis, has been questioned on the basis of limitations in our analytical approach, on the inappropriateness of some of the studies included in our data bases, and on the criteria used to select the levels of abiotic stress within each study. Here we provide additional arguments in defence of our approach and selection of studies, and perform further analyses of our data base that show that these criticisms are not well founded.
   2 The inclusion of studies with contrasting abiotic stress conditions does not invalidate per se tests of predictions derived from the stress-gradient hypothesis because the hypothesis does not specify that predictions should hold for a given difference, or range of differences, in abiotic stress.
   3 Our re-analyses show that differences in the length of stress gradient between the low and high stress levels across studies do not reduce the ability of meta-analysis to test predictions of the stress-gradient hypothesis, and that our approach does not suffer from 'hypothesis bias'.
   4 Species interactions across abiotic stress gradients do not follow a simple pattern, and there are specific circumstances under which the predictions arising from the stress-gradient hypothesis do not hold. This hypothesis requires profound revision if all situations that emerge when evaluating the relationship between plant interactions and abiotic stress are to be 'fit' by a single conceptual paradigm.

AB Anuran assemblages were studied regarding species composition, microhabitat partitioning, temporal distribution, and spatial distribution in three natural ponds. Twenty-two species belonging to four families (Bufonidae, Hylidae, Leptodactylidae, and Microhylidae) were recorded, 11 of these also in the larval stage. Month of occurrence, height above ground, and type of substrate were the most important variables discriminating among adult anuran microhabitats, whereas position in the water column, water depth, and presence of aquatic vegetation were the most important ones to discriminate among tadpole microhabitats. The total number of species and the number of species with calling males recorded were positively correlated with mean monthly rainfall and temperature. Tadpole species richness was not related to the number of types or abundance of potential tadpole predators in ponds. In the studied anuran assemblages, environmental and stochastic factors are more likely to produce the observed patterns of species distribution than biotic interactions.

AB Two concurrent 2 yr experiments were conducted along the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia (1) to examine competitive interactions between the invasive green alga Codium fragile ssp. tomentosoides and canopy-forming native seaweeds, particularly the dominant kelps (Laminaria longicruris and L. digitata) and opportunistic algae (Desmarestia viridis and D. aculeata), and (2) to identify conditions enabling the establishment and persistence of C. fragile. In the first experiment, Laminaria spp. and/or Desmarestia spp. were either removed or left intact (in an orthogonal factorial design) to examine their effect on C. fragile. At the end of the experiment, cover, density, and biomass of C. fragile did not differ significantly among treatments, although mean density was up to 2 times greater in plots where kelp was removed than in control plots. While removal of kelp positively affected growth of C. fragile (up to 12 cm mo(-1)) during the first year, growth was similar among treatments in the second year, when kelps were smaller and Desmarestia spp. were virtually absent (following decimation of native seaweeds by the invasive bryozoan Membranipora membranacea). Survival of marked individuals of C. fragile was high in all treatments in the first year (85 to 100 %), but dropped during winter in the second year (40 to 60 %). In the second experiment, the effect of stands of C. fragile on recolonization by Laminaria spp. and Desmarestia spp. was examined by removing C. fragile in both Pulse and Press removal treatments. At the end of the experiment, density of Laminaria spp. in the Press treatment was more than 4 times higher than in the Pulse treatment. Dense stands of C. fragile in control plots inhibited recruitment of kelps and other seaweeds, and survival of marked thalli of C. fragile over 9 mo was high (90 %). We conclude C. fragile exhibits competitive advantages over native seaweeds through opportunistic exploitation of disturbance-generated gaps within kelp beds. Once established as dense meadows, C. fragile prevents re-colonization by kelp and persists as the dominant canopy-forming seaweed for prolonged periods.

AB We studied possible interactions among invertebrate species and algal assemblages in a shallow sublittoral community of the Mediterranean Sea using a 2-step approach. First, we analysed the general pattern by correlation analysis. Thereafter, we experimentally assessed cause-effect relationships between the species or assemblages that were clearly related in the correlation study. The abundance of Cliona viridis (Schmidt 1862) was positively correlated with that of sea urchins and negatively correlated with fleshy algal cover. These relationships were confirmed by field experiments: treatments without fleshy algae, owing to both natural and simulated sea urchin grazing, promoted C. viridis growth significantly more than controls. Our results support the hypothesis that sea urchin grazing on seaweeds increases light availability at the basal stratum, which favours the primary production of the symbiotic zooxanthellae and thus C. viridis growth through nutrient transfer. We found a network of interactions with several signs, directions and strengths: a strong positive indirect interaction ('facilitation') between sea urchins and C. viridis, a negative direct interaction between sea urchins and seaweeds ('predation'), a negative direct interaction between seaweeds and C, viridis ('shading-interference') and a weaker but significant direct interaction between C, viridis and Pione vastifica ('space competition'). The multiple interactions observed suggest a cascade that involves 4 trophic levels: primary producers, herbivorous, carnivorous, and filter-feeders. This cascading process can have negative cryptic implications on the environment, as the excavating sponge C. viridis is a bio-eroder that may strongly impact the shallow sublittoral landscape by producing substrate weakening and instability. The knowledge acquired on the sign and strength of these multi-species interactions is useful to model and predict the responses of shallow benthic communities to anthropogenic disturbances (i.e. overfishing and eutrophication).

AB There is a growing need to predict ecological responses to long-term habitat change. However, statistical models for marine soft-substratum ecosystems are limited, and consequently there is a need for the development of such models. In order to assess the utility of statistical modelling approaches for predicting likely changes in species distributions under varying environmental conditions, we tested the utility of logistic modelling and classification approaches. We successfully developed models relating the presence/absence of common intertidal macrofauna to changing environmental variables such as sediment characteristics, depth/elevation, tidal currents and wind-wave (i.e. wind-generated wave activity) disturbance. The final model for each species contained between 1 and 6 variables, where the percentage correctly predicted was moderate to high, ranging from 59 to 97 %. We were also able to identify relationships between higher level variables such as estuary type, basin morphometry and catchment-draining processes in driving macrobenthic community composition; however, we were unable to fully test the utility of the classification approach due to differences in the scale at which the macrobenthic data was collected and the scale of the higher level physical variables. These models were developed and tested using data that covered a range of environmental conditions in 5 estuaries in New Zealand. Such broad-scale statistical models play a critical role in our understanding of the likely effects of large-scale habitat change. However, a greater understanding of the fine-scale mechanistic controls on species distributions such as life-history characteristics, density information and biotic interactions would potentially lead to the development of more sensitive models.

AB Bioturbation processes of a dense ophiuroid assemblage were studied by in situ time-lapse sediment-profile imagery (t-SPI) and laboratory tracer-experiments. The burrows of 4 Amphiura fliformis (Ophiuroida) individuals were visible throughout the t-SPI deployment. Mean burrow excavation was 2.9 cm(2) h(-1). Mounding ranged from 0 to 7.12 m(2) h(-1). Loss of sediment from the sediment-water interface ranged from 0 to 7.0 cm(2) h(-1). Bioturbation at the station was dominated by A. filiformis, whose presence appeared to mask the activity of conspecifics. Species interactions were investigated in terms of particle reworking by laboratory luminophore-tracer experiments of monocultures and species mixtures using A. filiformis, Leptopentacta elongata (Holothuroida) and Nephtys hombergii (Polychaeta). Bioturbation by these large species fit a symmetric non-local model well. Species interactions led to underyielding with respect to predicted additive species-effects. Treatments containing A. filiformis were significantly different from treatments without A. filiformis, and not significantly different from each other. When the data was processed on a per capita basis, multiculture treatments containing N. hombergii underyielded due to the high biomass of N. hombergii and its relatively low bioturbation activity. Ordination of a distance matrix derived from tracer profiles showed that tracer profiles produced by multispecies treatments were most similar to the strongest bioturbator, due to destruction of conspecific structures by the strongest bioturbator. Species interactions are not additive in terms of particle bioturbation, and may be difficult to predict without knowing in situ densities.

AB Marine bacterioplankton dominate microbial carbon biomass in surface waters of the oligotrophic ocean, yet there have been few studies examining rates of change in bacterioplankton assemblage composition in situ over time and across water masses. Temporal changes in bacterioplankton assemblage composition were investigated during 7 drifter studies of 24 to 360 h duration in the oligotrophic Gulf of Mexico, the North Pacific and the West Tropical Atlantic in 2001 to 2003, using an assemblage fingerprinting technique, automated rRNA intergenic-spacer analysis (ARISA). The similarity indices between assemblages collected over time in the same drifter changed on average by a Sorensen index of 0.12 d(-1) (comparing the presence/absence of operational taxonomic units, OTU) and a Whittaker index (comparing proportions in various OTU) of 0.17 d-1 per fingerprint, across all surface drifter studies. Fingerprints generated from 7 replicate bacterioplankton DNA samples collected at each of 2 stations were remarkably similar to each other, sharing a Whittaker index > 0.85. Despite this consistency over small spatial scales (< 2 km), no clear relationship was observed between the separation distance of sampling locations and similarity between assemblage fingerprints in the North Pacific and Atlantic gyres over mesoscales (10 to 3000 km), oscillating around a mean of 0.38 to 0.47 for each gyre. Our results suggest that factors ultimately shaping assemblage composition are localized at spatial scales between a few kilometers and about 50 km, i.e. this is a typical horizontal 'patch size', within which communities are relatively homogenous, perhaps because physical mixing (e.g. by eddies) may dominate over biological interactions. Our results also suggest that, while similar environmental factors may cause bacterioplankton assemblages to share a small portion of OTU between different sampling locations, biological factors selecting for particular bacterial types (e.g. viral lysis, grazing, antagonism, nutrition) may cause assemblage composition variability over short geographic distances.

AB Sedimentary habitats are complex associations of biotic, chemical, and physical processes comprising 'ecosystem function'. The relative importance of these processes to biogeochemical cycling in highly reactive, permeable sediments remains poorly understood. We report results from several field experiments in a muddy-sand intertidal flat dominated by 2 functionally different types of bioturbating macrofauna in False Bay, Washington, USA: (1) the arenicolid polychaete Abarenicola pacifica and (2) 2 species of thalassinid shrimp (Upogebia pugettensis and Neotrypaea californiensis). Experimental plots composed primarily of one of the study taxa or mixed communities of both were evaluated for their effects on porewater advection, solute concentrations, and sediment characteristics. Fluorescein-impregnated acrylamide gels were used to infer rates of transport, and acrylamide gel peepers were used to record porewater concentrations of diagenetically important constituents among experimental plots. Laboratory studies evaluated rates of diffusive transport in non-bioturbated sediments for comparative analysis. We found that (1) functionally different macrofauna affect rates of porewater advection in permeable sediments, (2) organism effects are not attributable to changes in average measures of sediment granulometry, (3) species interactions may further complicate the advective environment and the resulting diagenetic processes, and (4) species effects vary according to reaction rate kinetics. We hypothesize that species-related effects on transport are due to inhibition of arenicolid feeding by thalassinid tubes that serve to block sediment fluidization and advective flow. Thus, specific behaviors and interactions among organisms appear to affect transport rates and sediment function in advectively permeable habitats. The results indicate the importance of integrating behavior, kinetics, and transport into future studies of sedimentary biodiversity and ecosystem function.

AB On the basis of monthly samples, we measured the secondary production of the amphipod Jassa slatteryi Conlan 1990, on a Zostera marina L. seagrass bed in Gwangyang Bay, southern Korea. The standing crop of seagrass showed 2 peaks in spring and fall, with maximum biomass in May. Biomass distribution of J. slatteryi was positively correlated with the standing crop of seagrass (p < 0.05), suggesting that there is a biological interaction between these 2 species. J. slatteryi displays 2 main breeding periods during the year; in spring (March to May) and in fall (October to December). The biomass of J. slatteryi and the standing crop of seagrass in the spring was much higher than in the fall. The annual secondary production of J. slatteryi in the Gwangyang Bay seagrass bed (20.07 g dry weight m(-2) yr(-1)) is the highest reported in amphipods inhabiting seagrass beds. However, the annual production: biomass (P:B) ratio, at 5.21, was lower than recorded previously in both temperate and tropical seagrass beds because the number of generations decreases the P:B ratio. The combination of high abundance and secondary production suggests an important role for J. slatteryi in the seagrass-bed ecosystem as a trophic link from primary producers to higher consumers.

AB Biogenic habitat can structure marine communities by serving as both a complex substrate and food source for adult and recruiting organisms. We investigated the role played by biogenic habitats (Mytilus edulis and Crepidula spp. beds) in influencing the subtidal distribution (kilometers scale) of the mud crab Dyspanopeus sayi in Narragansett Bay, New England (USA). In field surveys, D. sayi were 1 to 2 orders of magnitude more abundant on M. edulis and Crepidula spp. beds than at sites lacking these habitats, and a laboratory experiment confirmed that D. sayi will consume both of these species. In a field-based, substrate-choice experiment, modules containing rocks had higher D. sayi recruit densities than those containing M. edulis or Crepidula spp. This indicates that structural complexity of those biogenic substrates, rather than their availability as prey, is the primary factor influencing patterns of D. sayi recruitment. Densities of recruit and adult D. sayi on recruitment modules were higher at bare sites than at sites with biogenic habitat, where modules represented islands of structure in otherwise simple habitat. This suggests small-scale habitat selection by D. sayi. Adult D. sayi occupied modules indiscriminately at bare sites, but exhibited a preference for modules containing mussels at sites with biogenic habitats. The importance of structure for adult and recruit D. sayi, reinforced by adults' response to prey presence, likely explains this organism's association with hard, biogenic habitats in the studied system.

AB Farmed salmon strains have been selected to improve growth rates as well as other traits of commercial interest but the 2 million farmed salmon escaping annually may enhance the risk of extinction of wild populations through genetic and ecological interactions. Here, we compare the transcription profiles of 3557 genes in the progeny of farmed and wild Atlantic salmon from Norway and Canada grown in controlled conditions, and demonstrate that five to seven generations of artificial selection led to heritable changes in gene transcription profiles, the average magnitude of the differences being 25% and 18% for at least 1.4% and 1.7% of the expressed genes in juvenile salmon from Norway and Canada, respectively. Moreover, genes showing significant transcription profile differences in both farmed strains (16%) all exhibited parallel changes. These findings, along with the identification of several genes whose expression profiles were modified through artificial selection, provide new insights into the molecular basis of parallel evolution, and suggest how gene flow from farmed escapees may affect the genetic integrity of wild populations.

AB In most regions of the world removal of environmental stress facilitates regeneration of native plants and habitats. However, in many of New Zealand's modified landscapes, exotic species are likely to respond first to any reduction in stress because these fast-growing species are prevalent in local vegetation and dominate seed banks. Given the trend in agriculture towards intensive management on larger units, the indigenous character in New Zealand landscapes is being marginalised and there is the risk that further reduction in visibility of native vegetation may be perpetuated by a growing familiarity and identification with ubiquitous exotic species. Alternative landscapes, based on an understanding of ecosystem processes, need to be explored if biodiversity coals set by international convention and national resource management law are to be achieved. This study provides a set of predictions and pathways, backed by field observations, to underpin a restoration strategy at patch to landscape scales. A forest model, LINKNZ, is employed to simulate species succession under New Zealand conditions. The incorporation of disturbance regimes and species dispersal processes in the model permits a wide range of scenarios to be investigated encompassing indigenous forest development, exotic species interactions with indigenous forest ecosystems, management of mixed introduced-indigenous forests, and landscape dynamics. The results illustrate an approach that identifies potential biosecurity threats and provides additional options for integrating nature and production in New Zealand's rural and urban landscapes.

AB Contemporary ecological landscape planning is often based on the assumption that small isolated habitat patches sustain relatively few species. Here, we suggest that for shallow lakes and ponds, the opposite can be true for some groups of organisms. Fish communities tend to be poor or even absent in small isolated lakes. However, submerged vegetation is often more abundant in such waterbodies. As a consequence of low fish biomass and high vegetation abundance, the richness of aquatic birds, plants, amphibians and invertebrates is often relatively high in small, shallow, isolated lakes. Although the rarity of fish is in line with expectations from the ruling paradigms about effects of habitat fragmentation in landscape ecology, the relative richness of various other groups of organisms in small ponds is opposite to these expectations. The case of shallow lakes illustrates that incorporating ecological interactions is essential to understanding the potential effects of habitat fragmentation. Single-species meta-population approaches may be misleading if ecological interactions are strong. A meta-community approach that explicitly incorporates biotic interactions, also those involving different trophic levels, is needed. Our diagnosis suggests that connection of isolated habitat fragments may in some cases reduce, rather than enhance, landscape-level biodiversity, and implies that biodiversity at the regional level will be maximized if the local habitat patches vary widely in size and degree of connectivity.

AB Knowledge of the effects of species diversity within taxonomic groups on nutrient cycling is important for understanding the rote of soil biota in sustainable agriculture. We hypothesized that earthworm species specifically affect nitrogen mineralization, characteristically for their ecological. group classifications, and that earthworm species interactions would affect mineralization through competition and facilitation effects. A mesocosm experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of three earthworm species, representative of different ecological. groups (epigeic: Lumbricus rubellus; endogeic: Aporrectodea caliginosa tuberculata; and anecic: Lumbricus terrestris), and their interactions on the bacterial. community, and on nitrogen mineralization from N-15-labelled crop residue and from soil organic matter.
   Our results indicate that L. rubellus and L. terrestris enhanced mineralization of the applied crop residue whereas A. caliginosa had no effect. On the other hand, L. rubellus and A. caliginosa enhanced mineralization of the soil, organic matter, whereas L. terrestris had no effect. The interactions between different earthworm species affected the bacterial. community and the net mineralization of soil organic matter. The two-species interactions between L. rubellus and A. caliginosa, and L. rubellus and L. terrestris, resulted in reduced mineral N concentrations derived from soil organic matter, probably through increased immobilization in the bacterial biomass. In contrast, the interaction between A. caliginosa and L. terrestris resulted in increased bacterial growth rate and reduced total soil C. When all three species were combined, the interaction between A. caliginosa and L. terrestris was dominant. We conclude that the effects of earthworms on nitrogen mineralization depend on the ecological traits of the earthworm species present, and can be modified by species interactions. Knowledge of these effects can be made useful in the prevention of nutrient losses and increased soil fertility in agricultural systems, that typically have a low earthworm diversity.

AB We tested if subalpine heath vegetation in northern Italy recovered after experimental perturbation of soil nutrient availability (fertilization) and species composition (removal of co-dominant dwarf shrubs). Species cover was assessed non-destructively before the start of the treatments (1995), at the end of the treatments (1999) and 4 years after the treatments ended (2003). Shrub removal had rather modest effects on heath vegetation, except for mosses which decreased significantly in removal plots. Fertilization decreased the cover of shrubs, mosses, and some graminoids but increased the cover of Festuca rubra. Fertilization converted heath to grassland, but the response of graminoid species was individualistic. Fertilization decreased vascular species richness and evenness, probably through negative effects of shading and litter accumulation on plant growth or recruitment. The vegetation had not recovered completely 4 years after the perturbations had stopped. This suggests that, in contrast to rapid responses to species removal and fertilization, recovery from these perturbations was rather slow, presumably because recovery was affected by long-term biotic interactions and species controls on ecosystem properties.

AB The timing of the snowmelt is a crucial factor in determining the phenological schedule of alpine plants. A long-term monitoring of snowmelt regimes in a Japanese alpine area revealed that the onset of the snowmelt season has been accelerated during the last 17 years in early snowmelt sites but that such a trend has not been detected in late snowmelt sites. This indicates that the global warming effect on the snowmelt pattern may be site-specific. The flowering phenology of fellfield plants in an exposed wind-blown habitat was consistent between an unusually warm year (1998) and a normal year (2001). In contrast, the flowering occurrence of snowbed plants varied greatly between the years depending on the snowmelt time. There was a large number of flowering species in the fellfield community from mid- to late to late June and from mid- to late July. The flowering peak of an early-melt snowbed plant community was in the middle of the flowering season and that of a late-melt snowbed community was in the early flowering season. These habitat-specific phenological patterns were consistent between 1998 and 2001. The effects of the variation in flowering timing on seed-set success were evaluated for an entomophilous snowbed herb, Peucedanum multivittatum, along the snowmelt gradient during a 5-year period. When flowering occurred prior to early August, mean temperature during the flowering season positively influenced the seed set. When flowering occurred later than early August, however, the plants enjoyed high seed-set success irrespective of temperature conditions if frost damage was absent. These observations are probably explained based on the availability of pollinators, which depends not only on ambient temperature but also on seasonal progress. These results suggest that the effects of climate change on biological interaction may vary depending on the specific habitat in the alpine ecosystem in which diverse snowmelt patterns create complicated seasonality for plants within a very localized area.

AB Low-density rural home development is the fastest-growing form of land use in the United States since 1950. This "exurban" development (similar to 6-25 homes/km(2)) includes urban fringe development (UFD) on the periphery of cities and rural residential development (RRD) in rural areas attractive in natural amenities. This paper synthesizes current knowledge on the effects of UFD and RRD. We present two case studies and examine the patterns of biodiversity response and the ecological mechanisms that may underlie these responses. We found that many native species have reduced survival and reproduction near homes, and native species richness often drops with increased exurban densities. Exotic species, some human-adapted native species, and species from early successional stages often increase with exurban development. These relationships are sometimes nonlinear, with sharp thresholds in biodiversity response. These effects may be manifest for several decades following exurban development, so that biodiversity is likely still responding to the wave of exurban expansion that has occurred since 1950. The location of exurban development is often nonrandom relative to biodiversity because both are influenced by biophysical factors. Consequently, the effects on biodiversity may be disproportionately large relative to the area of exurban development. RRD is more likely than UFD to occur near public lands; hence it may have a larger influence on nature reserves and wilderness species. The ecological mechanisms that may underlie these responses involve alteration of habitat, ecological processes, biotic interactions, and increased human disturbance. Research on the patterns and mechanisms of biodiversity remains underdeveloped, and comparative and experimental studies are needed. Knowledge resulting from such studies will increase our ability to understand, manage, and mitigate negative impacts on biodiversity.

AB We investigated the roles of local environmental conditions and dispersal limitation in zooplankton recovery from acidification in Swan Lake, Ontario, a historically acidified, metal-contaminated lake. We hypothesized that local environmental conditions (pH and the presence of resident, acid-tolerant zooplankton) would limit the establishment of several zooplankton colonist species. We tested this in a factorial mesocosm experiment that ran for 32 days during the mid summer. Ambient pH (5.6) reduced the abundance of two acid-sensitive cladoceran taxa, Daphnia spp. and Ceriodaphnia lacustris compared to elevated pH (6.5) but increased the abundance of cyclopoid copepod juveniles. The reside-it community suppressed Skistodiaptomus oregonensis and Diacyclops bicuspidatus thomasi, and to a lesser extent Mesocyclops edax, but slightly enhanced Daphnia spp. We also hypothesized that conditions in the sediments of acidified Swan Lake would limit zooplankton recruitment from diapausing eggs. We tested this by reciprocally transferring sediments containing eggs between Swan Lake and a nearby recovered lake, and incubating them for 15 weeks in 20-L emergence traps.,Most zooplankton emerged from diapause in both lakes indicating that this mechanism contributes to the recolonization of acidified lakes once pH returns to normal. Some species, however, emerged in only one lake or the other, indicating that hatching cues such as light, temperature, oxygen, or appropriate pH may have been missing. Our experiments demonstrate that both local lake conditions and diapausing eggs can influence zooplankton recovery. Continued recovery may require additional management efforts to reduce and control regional acid emissions and active intervention in the form of food web manipulations.

ID SUCCESSION
AB Discrete-time Markov chains are widely used to study communities of competing sessile species. Their parameters are transition probabilities between states (species found at points in space), estimated from repeated observations. The proportion of nonzero entries in the transition matrix has been suggested as a measure of the complexity of interspecific interactions. This is not accurate if more than one transition can occur per time interval. In such cases, continuous-time Markov chains may be better, and discrete-time models may overestimate the complexity of species interactions. We reanalyze data from a marine community. A continuous-time model with homogeneous rates is not significantly worse than the maximum-likelihood discrete-time model. Compared to the continuous-time model, the discrete-time model overestimates the complexity of interspecific interactions. We also discuss the entropy of a continuous-time Markov chain, another measure of complexity.

AB Both density-mediated and trait-mediated indirect biotic interactions may be important in structuring communities. Indirect interactions in many study systems remain unexplored; in part, because they are often difficult to detect, and in many instances, have been identified empirically only when unexpected results arise. Indirect effects induced by competition may be particularly important among organisms with complex life cycles, wherein competitive effects experienced in one life stage influence species interactions in one or more subsequent stages. We determined whether species-specific effects of larval competition in the mosquitoes Aedes albopictus and Aedes aegypti have indirect effects at the adult stage, specifically testing for effects on arboviral infection with Sindbis virus (SINV). For A. albopictus, but not for A. aegypti, competition resulted in greater infection, body titer, and dissemination rates compared to low-competition conditions. Whole body titers of virus increased with adult size irrespective of competition. However, between competitive treatments, mosquitoes from low-competition conditions had greater mean size, with lower infection rates and lower whole body titers than the smaller mosquitoes from high-competition conditions. These results suggest that larval competition, common in natural mosquito populations, has important indirect effects on adults by altering mosquito-virus interactions. Such indirect effects may change transmission parameters of pathogens.

AB Introduced species frequently escape the natural enemies (predators, competitors, and parasites) that limit their distribution and abundance in the native range. This reduction in native predators, competitors, and parasites may result in ecological release in the introduced range. However, biological interactions also can limit the establishment and spread of normative populations. The extent to which such biotic resistance occurs is poorly resolved., especially for marine ecosystems. Here we test whether a native predator, the blue crab Callinectes sapidus, affects the abundance and geographic range of the introduced European green crab Carcinus maenas in eastern North America. Both crab species occur in shallow, soft-sediment habitats of bays and estuaries, and their ranges overlap in eastern North America. First, we tested for a negative relationship in the abundances of the two species from trap samples across a 640-km (5.78 degrees latitude) coastal transect. Second, we estimated variation in predation pressure on tethered Carcinus maenas across latitude and as a function of Callinectes sapidus abundance. Third, we measured predation rates on Carcinus maenas by Callinectes sapidus in field and laboratory experiments. Our results support the hypothesis that the native predator Callinectes sapidus provides biotic resistance to invasion and prevents the southward spread and establishment of Carcinus maenas. Within and across bays, Carcinus maenas were significantly less abundant at sites and depths with Callinectes sapidus compared with areas lacking Callinectes sapidus. Moreover, no Carcinus maenas were found in Chesapeake Bay, where Callinectes sapidus were most abundant. Predation of tethered Carcinus maenas increased with Callinectes sapidus abundance. In laboratory and field experiments, Callinectes sapidus preyed readily on Carcinus maenas. Thus, we conclude the predation by Callinectes sapidus, alone or in combination with other factors, limits the abundance and geographic range of an invasive marine species.

AB Lichens produce a great number of secondary metabolites that participate in ecological interactions and respond to environmental changes. We examined the influence of heavy metal accumulations on lichen secondary metabolism. Thalli of Hypogymnia physodes were transplanted for 6 months to the Cracow-Silesia industrial region. Based on heavy metal accumulations in lichen, two of the investigated sites were classified as highly polluted. The highest concentrations of Cd, Pb, and Zn were found in lichens transplanted in the vicinity of a Zn-Pb smelter. Significant accumulations of Cr and Ni were detected in Hypogymnia transplanted near a chemical industry. Physodic, physodalic, hydroxyphysodic acids, and atranorin were identified and analyzed in extracts obtained from specimen samples. The most detrimental changes were observed in lichen transplanted into the vicinity of a chemical industry producing chromium, phosphor, and sulfur compounds that contained 340-fold higher Cr levels than control thalli. Decreases in the levels of physodic acid, hydroxyphysodic acid, and atranorin were detected, and one additional polar compound (probably product of degradation of lichen acids) appeared in the extract. The content of physodalic acid increased in every thalli sample transplanted, suggesting a possible role of this compound in defense against stress caused by accumulated pollutants. The levels of physodic acid decreased in thalli from both of the most polluted sites compared to those of the controls-but were not changed in thalli transplanted to less polluted sites. Our results illustrate that lichen compounds are sensitive to heavy metal accumulation and could be used as biomarkers in environmental studies.

AB The factors that control biodiversity have been the focus of numerous recent investigations; these include species interactions, speciation, environmental gradients and heterogeneity, all of these operating differently at each observation scale. We used a null model to examine the influence of two forces shaping the community structure of Dactylogyrus species parasitic on roach (Rutilus rutilus) gills: interspecific competition that might prevent the coexistence of the most similar species and environmental filters that might result in the most similar species coexisting together. The study was carried out on two sets of fish from two different localities in the Morava river basin (Czech Republic) to evaluate the consistency of the results across host populations, and at three different scales of observation to test for the scale dependence of assembly rules. In decreasing order, from largest to smallest, the three spatial scales investigated were: the individual fish, the individual gill arch and individual sections of each gill arch. The similarity between pairs of parasite species was measured using three different criteria: (1) phylogeny, (2) quantitative functional traits consisting of parasite size and morphometric measurements of the attachment organ's sclerotized parts and (3) qualitative attributes of reproductive organs. First, our study reveals a strong conservatism of ecological characters for the nine Dactylogyrus parasite species, in particular regarding the attributes of their copulatory organs. Second, our study did not find any limitation of similarity among coexisting Dactylogyrus species due to interspecific competition, irrespective of the scale and the similarity measures considered. Conversely, our results support the niche filtering hypothesis, preventing the co-occurrence of species too dissimilar from one another. This process is particularly apparent at the scale of the individual fish and for functional traits associated with the hard parts of the parasites' attachment organs. In both localities, the Dactylogyrus species that occur on the same fish individuals tend to have similar values for the haptor dimensions. Our study supports previous studies on monogenean parasite communities indicating a weak influence of competition as a structuring force, but it goes a step further by identifying environmental filtering as a key process shaping these communities.

AB A positive relationship between plant species richness and ecosystem functioning has been found in a number of experimental studies. Positive species interactions at high species numbers have been suggested as a cause, but mechanisms driving positive interactions have not often been tested. In this experiment we asked three questions: (1) What is the relationship between species richness and productivity in experimentally constructed moss communities? (2) Is this relationship affected by plant density? and (3) Can changes in moisture absorption and retention explain observed relationships? To answer these questions we exposed arctic tundra moss communities of different species richness levels (1-11 species) and two different densities in the greenhouse to two levels of drought (short and long). Biomass (by the community and individual species), height and community moisture absorption and retention were measured as response variables. High species diversity increased productivity (more so in low-density plots than in high-density plots), but only when plots were watered regularly. Plot moisture retention was improved at high species richness as well, and plant height and variation in height was increased compared to plants in monoculture. Under high-density and short-drought conditions 10 out of 12 species grew better in mixture than in monoculture, but under the long drought treatment only six species did. A positive feedback loop between biomass and improved humidity under high diversity was supported by path analysis. We conclude that in this community the relationship between species richness and productivity depends on moisture availability and density, with improved water absorption and retention likely to be the mechanism for increased plant growth when drought periods are short. Furthermore, since this is the opposite of what has been found for temperate moss communities, conclusions from one system cannot automatically be extrapolated to other systems.

AB Studies in aquatic systems have shown that habitat complexity may provide refuge or reduce the number of encounters prey have with actively searching predators. For ambush predators, habitat complexity may enhance or have no effect on predation rates because it conceals predators, reduces prey detection by predators, or visually impairs both predators and prey. We investigated the effects of habitat complexity and predation by the ambush predators Toxorhynchites rutilus and Corethrella appendiculata on their mosquito prey Aedes albopictus and Ochlerotatus triseriatus in container analogs of treeholes. As in other ambush predator-prey systems, habitat complexity did not alter the effects of T. rutilus or C. appendiculata whose presence decreased prey survivorship, shortened development time, and increased adult size compared to treatments where predators were absent. Faster growth and larger size were due to predator-mediated release from competition among surviving prey. Male and female prey survivorship were similar in the absence of predators, however when predators were present, survivorship of both prey species was skewed in favor of males. We conclude that habitat complexity is relatively unimportant in shaping predator-prey interactions in this treehole community, where predation risk differs between prey sexes.

AB Spatial patterns in plant communities are thought to be controlled by the interplay of species interactions and environmental constraints. To evaluate the role of plant-plant interactions in shaping these communities we quantified species co-occurrence and interaction in seven environmentally distinct communities. These included four different semiarid habitats in southeast Spain, one alpine system in the Sierra Nevada range (Spain), and two sites in Venezuela, a secondary savanna near Caracas (Altos de Pipe), and a sclerophyllous shrubland in the Gran Sabana plateau. We expected that facilitation would be stronger at sites with more spatial associations. The four semiarid sites in Spain and the shrubland in Gran Sabana showed a high degree of positive species associations. Of the other two communities, one showed both positive and negative associations while negative ones predominated in Altos de Pipe. The direct experimental measure of neighbors' effect showed that positive interactions among species prevailed in communities where positive species associations dominated. The appearance of benefactor species in patches increased species richness compared with the surrounding inter-shrub spaces. Our results provide a link between spatial patterns and species interactions, where aggregation points to positive interactions and segregation to competitive or interference effects. Facilitation appears as a relevant process shaping communities under environmental constraints.

AB Increasing evidence shows that facilitative interaction and negative plant-soil feedback are driving factors of plant population dynamics and community processes. We studied the intensity and the relative impact of negative feedback on clonal growth and seed germination of Scirpus holoschoenus, a 'ring' forming sedge dominant in grazed grassland, and the consequences for species coexistence. The structure of aboveground tussocks was described. A Lithium tracer assessed belowground distribution of functional roots. Seed rain and seedling emergence were compared for different positions in relation to Scirpus tussocks. Soil bioassays were used to compare growth on soil taken from inside and outside Scirpus tussocks of four coexisting species (Mentha acquatica, Pulicaria dysenterica, Scirpus holoschoenus and Dittrichia viscosa). We also compared plant performance of dominant plant species inside and outside Scirpus tussocks in the field. The 'ring' shaped tussocks of S. holoschoenus were generated by centrifugal rhizome development. Roots were functional and abundant under the tillers and extending outside the tussocks. The large roots mats that were present in the inner tussock zone were almost all dead. Seedling emergence and growth both showed a strong negative feedback of Scirpus in the inner tussock zone. Scirpus clonal development strongly reduced grass biomass. In the degenerated tussock zone, Pulicaria and Mentha mortality was lower, and biomass of individual plants and seed production were higher. This positive indirect interaction could be related to species-specific affinity to soil conditions generated by Scirpus, and interspecific competitive release in the degenerated tussock zone. We conclude that Scirpus negative feedback affects its seedling emergence and growth contributing to the development of the degenerated inner tussock zone. Moreover, this enhances species coexistence through facilitative interaction because the colonization of the inner tussock zone is highly species-specific.

AB A brackish water ecotone of coastal bays and lakes, mangrove forests, salt marshes, tidal creeks, and upland hammocks separates Florida Bay, Biscayne Bay, and the Gulf of Mexico from the freshwater Everglades. The Everglades mangrove estuaries are characterized by salinity gradients that vary spatially with topography and vary seasonally and inter-annually with rainfall, tide, and freshwater flow from the Everglades. Because of their location at the lower end of the Everglades drainage basin, Everglades mangrove estuaries have been affected by upstream water management practices that have altered the freshwater heads and flows and that affect salinity gradients. Additionally, interannual variation in precipitation patterns, particularly those caused to El Nino events, control freshwater inputs and salinity dynamics in these estuaries. Two major external drivers on this system are water management activities and global climate change. These drivers lead to two major ecosystem stressors: reduced freshwater flow volume and duration, and sea-level rise. Major ecological attributes include mangrove forest production, soil accretion, and resilience; coastal lake submerged aquatic vegetation; resident mangrove fish populations; wood stork (Mycteria americana) and roseate spoonbill (Platelea ajaja) nesting colonies; and estuarine crocodilian populations. Causal linkages between stressors and attributes include coastal transgression, hydroperiods, salinity gradients, and the "white zone" freshwater/estuarine interface. The functional estuary and its ecological attributes, as influenced by sea level and freshwater flow, must be viewed as spatially dynamic, with a possible near-term balancing of transgression but ultimately a long-term continuation of inland movement. Regardless of the spatio-temporal timing of this transgression, a salinity gradient supportive of ecologically functional Everglades mangrove estuaries will be required to maintain the integrity of the South Florida ecosystem.

AB The St. Lucie Estuary is one of the largest brackish water bodies on the east coast of Florida, USA and a major tributary to southern Indian River Lagoon. The Indian River Lagoon is a biogeographic transition zone, rich in habitats and species, with the greatest species diversity of any estuary in North America. Habitats and species diversity in the lagoon system are believed to be affected by the decline in water and sediment quality. The health of the system is being affected by water management and land-use development in this rapidly growing area of South Florida. These affects are expressed through the six major stressors identified in this conceptual ecological model. The model diagram and its associated text describe the effects of these stressors on the key ecological attributes of the system and are a way to describe both the well-known linkages and pathways between these stressors and the detrimental impacts they have on the ecology of the system. This model also provides a means to describe some of the uncertainties and associated research that will be needed to fine tune our understanding of some of the more complicated ecological interactions and interdependencies in order to carry out effectively the goals and objectives of Everglades restoration in this system and adaptively manage the restoration into the future.

AB Most demersal species of damselfish (family Pomacentridae) are territorial herbivores that aggressively chase other fishes away from their nests. This study investigates whether the aggressive territorial damselfish, Stegastes leitcostictus, modifies behaviours and home range area use in a less aggressive, non-territorial species, the slippery dick wrasse, Halichoeres bivittatits (family Labridae). Damselfishes and wrasses are ubiquitous and abundant members of coral reef fish assemblages around the world; hence, this study has broader implications beyond the two Caribbean species chosen for this study. A manipulative field experiment consisted of transplanting one or three S. leitcostictus into artificial shelters positioned within adult or adjacent to juvenile H. bivittatus home ranges. The introduction of damselfish had little effect on the size of home range areas of juvenile or adult wrasses, but had a significant effect on the location of their home ranges. The damselfish also affected adult microhabitat use but did not affect use by juveniles. In addition, there was an increase in damselfish-wrasse interactions that resulted in a significant reduction in the amount of time adult wrasses could spend foraging or in a foraging assemblage. It was concluded that aggressive interactions with territorial damselfish affect individual H. bivittatits space use and may consequently affect the spatial distribution of H. bivittatus populations.

AB Exotic plant species can affect native plant species both directly via competition and indirectly by modifying native species' interactions with other organisms in the community. Both direct and indirect effects can have strong fitness impacts on the native species and can result in cascading effects throughout the invaded community. Many exotic plant species escape from the herbivores with which they co-evolved, but in our study system, the exotic Egyptian alfalfa weevil (Hypera brunneipennis) has been introduced to California and is able to feed both on the exotic plant Medicago polymorpha and on the California native Lotus wrangelianus. Because these two plant species share this common herbivore, the possibility of strong herbivore-mediated indirect interactions between these introduced and native plant species is plausible.
   We used observational studies and manipulative field experiments to determine whether exotic Medicago affects herbivory on the native Lotus and whether Medicago reduces the fitness of Lotus through direct competitive effects and/or herbivore-mediated indirect effects. Both observational and experimental data indicate that Medicago increases weevil herbivory on the native Lotus. Additionally, Medicago reduced Lotus fitness through direct as well as indirect mechanisms. In 2002, Medicago reduced Lotus fitness even when herbivores were experimentally reduced, suggesting direct competitive effects of Medicago on the native Lotus. In contrast, in 2003, Medicago reduced Lotus fitness only in the presence of herbivores, indicating that the fitness effects in that year were largely indirect and mediated by herbivores. Our results demonstrate that the net fitness consequences of indirect and direct effects of exotic plant species on native plants can vary temporally, depending on the abundance of members of the herbivore community. Also, rather than limiting the success of exotics, introduced herbivores that feed on exotic plants may provide additional, indirect avenues through which exotic plants can reduce the fitness of native species.

AB As new arctic marine fisheries develop there is need for a comprehensive ecosystem approach to long-term management. This approach recognizes the importance of community interactions such as food web structure and trophic patterns. We determined whether hierarchical clustering (guild formation) is an effective method of trophic evaluation in deep-sea Artic fish communities using stomach content and parasite data with size class, and evaluated the application of endohelminth communities (parasite species transmitted in the food) as indicators of trophic status. Cluster analysis using food group abundance with size class of fish revealed the presence of 11 guilds within the community, however the same analysis using parasite data showed little correlation between food and parasites. Redundancy analysis (RDA) within the 11 guilds also revealed no significant correlations between food group and parasite abundance suggesting that this type of ordination is not suited for environments containing mainly generalist feeders. RDA of individual taxa without a priori guild designation found that taxa in benthic deep-sea communities are defined by their ability to exploit prey species in more than one habitat zone. Benthic fish species were significantly correlated with benthic food groups and parasites that utilize benthic intermediate hosts whereas benthopelagic-pelagic species fed on a higher diversity of prey species and were infected by a larger number of non-host specific parasites. Eigenanalysis and Monte Carlo results showed that parasites and food groups are highly correlated, indicating that parasite community analysis is an effective tool for predicting feeding strategies in Arctic marine environments. It also suggests that in most cases endoparasite infections alone could be used for trophic evaluation in the absence of stomach content data.

AB At the edge of a species range, plants may experience myriad microenvironmental gradients, which may differ and impose strong yet complex selective regimes. We explore these issues using the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana, a native of Europe that has naturalized in North America, which we planted in a common garden field plot in Knoxville, Tennessee and observed across two biotic gradients. We found evidence that directional selection favors increased plant size, consistent with hypotheses of plant responses to novel environments. However, selection differed among plants with fungus gnat larvae damage, aphid damage, and plants that escaped herbivory, evidence that the selective landscape is variable and complex even for quasi-natural field plots. We did not uncover evidence for resistance; however, our results suggest that tolerance of A. thaliana may play an important role for population establishment and persistence in the presence of herbivores in a novel environment. Our findings highlight the variation in one segment of the biotic selective landscape of field environments, as well as the importance of biotic interactions in shaping the success of recently established populations that may be a critical component of post-invasion evolution.

AB 1. We develop a process-based bioenergetic model that incorporates population dynamics to predict the abundance trends for Anolis lizards along elevation gradients in the Lesser Antilles islands. Model outcomes are compared with empirical abundance trends on islands with and without species interactions and with differential topography.
   2. The bioenergetic model incorporating body size, thermal physiology and prey abundance qualitatively predicts how lizard abundance declines with elevation for solitary anole species. Empirical elevation trends on northern and southern one-species islands have similar slopes but different intercepts at sea level. The greater anole abundance on the southern islands is predicted by the model when parameterized with the empirically observed higher insect abundance.
   3. Anole abundance patterns on two-species islands diverge from the bioenergetic model predictions. One species is more abundant at sea level and the other more abundant at higher elevations compared with the trend for solitary anoles. Species interactions modify population responses to elevation gradients.

AB Adaptive speciation occurs when frequency-dependent ecological interactions generate conditions of disruptive selection to which lineage splitting is an adaptive response. Under such selective conditions, evolution of assortative mating mechanisms enables the break-up of the ancestral lineage into diverging and reproductively isolated descendent species. Extending previous studies, I investigate models of adaptive speciation due to the evolution of indirect assortative mating that is based on three different mating traits: the degree of assortativity, a female preference trait and a male marker trait. For speciation to occur, linkage disequilibria between different mating traits, e.g. between female preference and male marker traits, as well as between mating traits and the ecological trait, must evolve. This can lead to novel speciation scenarios, e.g. when reproductive isolation is generated by a splitting in the degree of assortativeness, with one of the emerging lineages mating assortatively, and the other one disassortatively. I investigate the effects of variation in various model parameters on the likelihood of speciation, as well as robustness of speciation to introducing costs of assortative mating. Even though in the models presented speciation requires the genetic potential for strong assortment as well as rather restrictive ecological conditions, the results show that adaptive speciation due to the evolution of assortative mating when mate choice is based on separate female preference and male marker traits is a theoretically plausible evolutionary scenario.

AB Here we describe, determine the prevalence, and examine the host-specificity of some parasitic nematode microfilariae in selected bird species from West and Central Africa. We used microscopy to determine the prevalence of microfilariae in 969 host individuals representing 121 rainforest bird species from Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire and Equatorial Guinea. Thirteen (11%) of these potential host species harboured microfilariae, and 35 individuals (3.6%) were infected. From the 35 infected individuals, we identified eight distinct morphological microfilarial forms. Sixteen of the 35 infected individuals were of one host species, the Fire-crested Alethe (Alethe diademata), at a prevalence rate of 62%. To examine host and geographical specificity, we sequenced a portion of the LSU rDNA gene from representative microfilariae drawn from different hosts and collecting locations. Identical sequences of the nematode LSU rDNA gene were found in A. diademata collected from locations in Cote d'Ivoire and Equatorial Guinea, locations separated by the Dahomey Gap and associated with different hypothesized refugial areas. In contrast, several other bird species collected at the same sites harboured different microfilaria lineages. We sequenced the mitochondrial ATP synthase genes of the host species A. diademata, and found a 5.4% sequence divergence between the birds sampled in Cote d'Ivoire, and those from Cameroon. Thus, despite this split between the two populations, they harbour microfilariae with identical lineages. These data provide evidence that the microfilariae found in A. diademata may be highly host specific. This apparent specificity may have important implications for the evolutionary and ecological interactions between parasitic nematodes and their avian hosts.

AB Ecological character displacement (ECD) provides opportunities to test how resource competition generates diversifying selection that results in adaptive divergence. We quantify an association between phenotypic and ecological divergence between two similar small fishes, brook (Culaea inconstans) and ninespine (Pungitius pungitius) sticklebacks, in replicate northern Ontario lakes, Canada. The two species partition resources and habitat, where they coexist, and brooks that coexist with ninespines are more benthically specialized in body form and diet than brooks from local allopatric populations. Here we test various explanations for this pattern. Chance is unlikely to have been the primary cause because divergence is replicated in three separate populations. Preliminary comparisons indicate that resource availability and a variety of abiotic ecological conditions are generally similar between sympatric and allopatric sites, and so do not readily account for the divergence. Biased colonization or extinction is less likely to account for the divergence because character values in sympatry tend to exceed those in allopatry, as expected if they have repeatedly evolved under diversifying selection. Recent studies have also demonstrated that these two species compete, and that competitive effects are more severe for allopatric compared to sympatric brook forms, as predicted if divergence reflects the ghost of competition past. Ongoing studies indicate heritable variation in this system. Our results suggest that even small amounts of character shifts can influence competition and hence relative fitness, further implicating a role for ECD in the evolution of biodiversity.

AB Different mechanisms, including equilibrium and non-equilibrium processes, have been taken into account as possible theoretical explanations of species coexistence. Despite the ample evidence on the existence of negative plant-soil feedback in both agriculture and natural vegetation, the role of these processes in the organization and dynamics of plant communities has so far been neglected. In this study, simulations by an individual-based competition model show how the intensity of negative feedback on individual plant performance can produce faster successional dynamics and allow species coexistence in two- and multi-species systems. The results show that even low levels of negative plant-soil feedback can enable species coexistence and often produce cyclic population dynamics. Moreover, the model highlights how negative feedback can generate positive reciprocal interspecific interactions at the population level, despite the fact that only competitive interactions is present between individual plants. In fact, competitive effects occur on a short-term scale, but positive reciprocal species interactions emerge only if negative feedback affects all species and if longer periods of simulation, more than the species life span, are considered. An important outcome of the model is the evidence that the effects at population level are timescale-dependent, thus showing the limitation of short-term species removal experiments used in traditional competition studies.

AB Different species in a community can be ranked according to the strength of their effect on the dynamics of the entire community. Despite a considerable research effort on community structure and the "keystone" species concept, there are still unresolved issues in this area. This work addresses the suitability of different methods of characterising community members,: either. by relative abundance, or different measures of competitive ability. Multi species, competitive communities were simulated to allow comparison, of methods that rank community members by either their abundance or competitive, ability. Results. indicate that characterising species according to their relative density, rather than competitive ability, provides a more refined measure of the importance of each community member. The analysis is extended by assessing which species are most likely-to be involved with cascading extinction events, showing that the species with the lowest abundance is most likely to face extinction. Here it is also shown that removal of the most abundant, species, i.e. that with the greatest relative density within the community, leads to the. highest, probability of community collapse, with further loss of; community members through cascading extinctions. The asymmetry, and non-linearity of between species interactions mean that species' ranking can change unexpectedly following species loss. These results can lead to practical recommendations in management decisions for conservation and other species management,problems, e.g.,harvesting in marine: food-webs, where it may be difficult to assess relative competitive ability between species in the ecosystem.

AB Habitat loss and subsequent subdivision of remaining habitat patches are considered major threats to terrestrial animal populations in natural environments. Habitat loss normally results in reduced population numbers in remaining habitat patches, whereas isolation of habitat patches affects population dynamics among them. In this study, we examined the distribution of the eastern chipmunk (Tamias striatus) in farmland woodlots. We used the Random Sample Hypothesis as a theoretical starting point in the study. By using a standard protocol to trap chipmunks in woodlots, we expected to capture approximately the same number of individuals per woodlot independent of the size of the woodlot. We found that the probability of capturing chipmunks declined with increasing size and distance to the nearest woodlots. Such a decline in densities seemed to happen even in woodlots of less than 10 ha. Large and remote woodlots tended to be surrounded by corn fields. Measured habitat and landscape variables gave no indication as to which ecological processes might have accounted for the observed pattern. Ecological factors, such as species interactions within a woodlot and movement of individuals among woodlots, should be addressed more closely experimentally.

AB Several theoretical studies propose that biodiversity buffers ecosystem functioning against environmental fluctuations, but virtually all of these studies concern a single trophic level, the primary producers. Changes in biodiversity also affect ecosystem processes through trophic interactions. Therefore, it is important to understand how trophic interactions affect the relationship between biodiversity and the stability of ecosystem processes. Here we present two models to investigate this issue in ecosystems with two trophic levels. The first is an analytically tractable symmetrical plant-herbivore model under random environmental fluctuations, while the second is a mechanistic ecosystem model under periodic environmental fluctuations. Our analysis shows that when diversity affects net species interaction strength, species interactions - both competition among plants and plant-herbivore interactions - have a strong impact on the relationships between diversity and the temporal variability of total biomass of the various trophic levels. More intense plant competition leads to a stronger decrease or a lower increase in variability of total plant biomass, but plant-herbivore interactions always have a destabilizing effect on total plant biomass. Despite the complexity generated by trophic interactions, biodiversity should still act as biological insurance for ecosystem processes, except when mean trophic interaction strength increases strongly with diversity.

AB Adaptations and, counteradaptations are common in coevolving predatorprey systems, but little is known of the role of maternal transfer of adaptive traits in mediating species interactions. Here, we focused on tolerance against cyanobacterial toxins and asked whether this tolerance was an induced defense developed during Daphnia's lifetime, whether it was a trait that is constantly expressed, and whether such tolerance to the toxin can be transferred to the next generation through maternal effects. These questions were addressed by feeding a single clone of Daphnia magna a diet with and without algal toxin and recording changes in fitness (as intrinsic rate of population increase). Analysis of F1, F2, and F3 generations revealed that the increased tolerance to toxic Microcystis was an inducible defense developed during an individual's lifetime, and that this trait could be transferred from mother to offspring. This maternal effect was expressed in several fitness parameters, including shorter time to maturity and first reproduction, and higher numbers of offspring compared to inexperienced individuals. In some circumstances, such maternal effects may increase population production by up to 40% and may help to stabilize material and energy transfer to higher trophic levels.

AB The balance of evidence strongly indicates that the ecological repercussions of climatic changes are already apparent in the dynamics of animal and plant populations throughout terrestrial, marine, and aquatic ecosystems. However, while considerable progress has been made in quantifying effects of such climate change on spatiotemporal shifts in distribution, density, and phenology, subtle effects such as intra-annual variation in behavior have been ignored. Yet individual-based assessments of short-term dynamics of species interactions may be critical to improving our understanding of the implications of climate change for population and community dynamics. Using comprehensive, spatially replicated data on seasonal plant growth dynamics and seasonal distribution of muskoxen over a seven-year period, we show that interannual variations in the North Atlantic Oscillation affect the seasonal spatial dynamics of plant growth and; thereby, the seasonal spatial dynamics and social organization of muskoxen. Our results demonstrate a clear role of large-scale climate in the short-term trophic dynamics of this simple, arctic community.

AB We evaluate whether species interaction frequency can be used as a surrogate for the total effect of a species on another. Because interaction frequency is easier to estimate than per-interaction effect, using interaction frequency as a surrogate of total effect could facilitate the large-scale analysis of quantitative patterns of species-rich interaction networks. We show mathematically that the correlation between interaction frequency (I) and total effect (T) becomes more strongly positive the greater the variation of I relative to the variation of per-interaction effect (P) and the greater the correlation between I and P. A meta-analysis using data on I, P and T for animal pollinators and seed dispersers visiting plants shows a generally strong, positive relationship between T and I, in spite of no general relationship between P and I. Thus, frequent animal mutualists usually contribute the most to plant reproduction, regardless of their effectiveness on a per-interaction basis.

AB We conducted an analysis of species associations using fish diversity and abundance surveys conducted in Bonaire Marine Park by recreational divers. We used data from the REEF (Reef Environmental Education Foundation) Fish Survey Project to compute Bray-Curtis similarity coefficients for all species pairs for the 100 most abundant species. We quantified relationships between species using hierarchical agglomerative clustering and non-metric multidimensional scaling (MDS) of the matrix of Bray-Curtis similarity coefficients. We identified three clusters of species from the analysis. MDS results showed species clusters occupied distinct regions across a continuous gradient of species in two-dimensional space, rather than form distinct clusters. While differences in habitat requirements can explain some of the pattern in pairwise species interactions, these results suggest that there are significant direct and indirect behavioral interactions mediating the distribution and abundance of species. Studies conducted to elucidate patterns of species-habitat relationships have been central to conservation planning for marine protected areas (MPAs). However, the role of behavioral interactions between species driving the dynamics of species composition within MPA networks, designed for representation of biological diversity, should be considered when selecting sites in order to be effective.

AB For at least 200 years, Gomoti River people and their neighbours lived interactively with the Okavango flood pulse system, travelling widely in dugout canoes, practicing flood recession agriculture, fishing, hunting, and collecting wild foods. Today they are wetlanders without wetlands. A major outflow channel of the eastern Okavango Delta in the 1930s, the Gomoti River rarely flows these days. This paper explores the Gomoti's demise, through the lenses first of science and second of Gomoti basin residents. Models developed over the past 20 years attribute the Gomoti's drying to a complex set of bio-hydrologic processes and feedback loops that begin with sedimentation and conclude with channel switching, peat fires, and purging of toxic salts. Such models essentially omit the long history of human habitation and ecological interaction with the delta. Local people, on the other hand, tell of deliberate and systematic management of channels and floodplains, and they argue this management kept the river healthy and flowing. The picture is confounded by colonial era interventions and by Botswana government policies partitioning the Gomoti and restricting access to its headwaters. We conclude with a model combining meso-scale scientific explanation with micro-scale indigenous constructions as a context for new thinking about Okavango Delta resource management.

AB Introduced brown trout, Salmo trutta, are common to many streams of western North America. However, the ecological interactions between brown trout and native stream fishes are not Well Understood, particularly the nature and extent of antipredator, responses of native species. We examined the effects of brown trout presence on diurnal habitat use by 2 small native fishes at a mesohabitat scale (e.g., pool, riffle, run, backwater, etc.). Adult and juvenile southern leatherside chub (Lepidomeda aliciae, formerly Cila copei) and juvenile mountain sucker (Catostomus platyrhynchus) were located in main channel pools in the absence of brown trout, but they were found almost exclusively in backwaters and cutoff pools (i.e., off-channel habitats) in streams where brown trout were abundant. Off-channel habitat appears to provide it refuge for native fishes in streams with abundant brown trout populations. Altered or degraded streams may not include sufficient off-channel refuge habitats to allow coexistence of native Species and introduced brown trout.

AB Distribution and abundance patterns at the community and metacommunity scale can result from two distinct mechanisms. Random dispersal followed by non-random, site-specific mortality (species sorting) is the dominant paradigm in community ecology, while habitat selection provides an alternative, largely unexplored, mechanism with different demographic consequences. Rather than differential mortality, habitat selection involves redistribution of individuals among habitat patches based on perceived rather than realized fitness, with perceptions driven by past selection. In particular, habitat preferences based on species composition can create distinct patterns of positive and negative covariance among species, generating more complex linkages among communities than with random dispersal models. In our experiments, the mere presence of predatory fishes, in the absence of any mortality, reduced abundance and species richness of aquatic beetles by up to 80% in comparison with the results from fishless controls. Beetle species' shared habitat preferences generated distinct patterns of species richness, species composition and total abundance, matching large-scale field patterns previously ascribed to random dispersal and differential mortality. Our results indicate that landscape-level patterns of distribution and species diversity can be driven to a large extent by habitat selection behaviour, a critical, but largely overlooked, mechanism of community and metacommunity assembly.

AB Individual-based models (IBM) extend the potential of ecological models to cope with spatial heterogeneity and complex ecological interaction networks with variable structures. This paper introduces a series of IBM-applications in the ecosystem research project 'Bornhoved Lakes District'. Here we outline the general theoretical implications of individual-based modelling related to self-organisation processes and emergent properties in different fields of ecological research and characterise the conceptual basis common to these applications. The case studies introduced are:
   spatial dispersal and colonisation processes of terrestrial arthropods
   community dynamics and trophic interaction in small mammals
   limnological application-spatially explicit fish energetic population model
   plant root system development and nutrient acquisition dynamics
   plant architecture and assimilation physiology
   We used the IBM-approach to analyse fundamental biocenotical interactions and investigate, how dispersal processes, behavioural characteristics and energetics at the level of individual organisms are linked with the population level and community processes as well as with ecosystem and landscape structures. The ecosystem based investigations are presented together with an overview of the employed modelling methodology. In addition, it is explained, how the conceptual background of emergent properties is involved in this approach. The individual-based modelling approach allows realistic descriptions and is highly adaptive to particular contexts and questions under investigation. Its main feature is that the characteristics of higher level ecological units like populations or communities can be determined as emergent properties from the lower ones.

AB Ecology requires the conceptual and technical ability to analyse complex and dynamic systems consisting of a high and variable number of components and relations. These components are part of a variable interaction structure in a spatially heterogeneous context. The components of ecological interaction networks can give rise to self-organised, and scale-dependent interaction patterns and processes, which are the underlying causes of the overall ecological systems states.
   The individual-based modelling approach provides a widely applicable simulation framework based on a 'hierarchy theory' view of ecological systems.
   Here, we summarise and generalise the theoretical implications of the modelling studies presented in this volume in the field of terrestrial and aquatic, animal and plant ecology. The case studies cover a representative profile of processes related to ecological applications, such as food web interactions, population dynamics, dispersal, energy physiology, nutrient allocation and mutual impact of morphological and physiological development. The generic approach applied in this context allows a hierarchical representation of ecological systems and their components. Model results are obtained as self-organised structural relation networks and as aggregated quantitative states. In order to address different model characteristics we distinguish collective and emergent properties. Collective properties are those that are attributed equally to different organisation levels of the system. Emergent properties result from the activities of lower level entities on a higher organisation level, while not being present on the lower level. They can be subdivided into aggregational and connective properties. Emergent properties that are aggregational are those which emerge as a result of an aggregation procedure by an observer on the higher level which does not make sense or is not applicable on lower levels. Emergent properties that are connective, however, are based on an interaction network of lower level entities, which brings about the specific system characteristic.
   This classification of model results will allow to generalise the achievements and potential of the individual-based modelling approach in ecology. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We examine the role of ecological interactions on effective gene flow from genetically manipulated plants to their wild relatives. We do so by constructing and applying to oilseed rape (OSR) an analytical model for interaction between plants with and without an insect resistance (IR) allele in natural communities, incorporating documented levels of herbivore variability. We find that with reasonable values of advantage to the IR allele, little concomitant disadvantage (physiological costs of the allele) restricts it to low proportions of the natural population for large numbers of generations. We conclude that OSR IR transgenes are unlikely to pose an immediate threat to natural communities.
   Our model identifies those factors best able to regulate particular transgenes at the population level, the most effective being impaired viability of seeds in the period between production and the following growing season, although other possibilities exist. Because solutions rely on ratios, limiting values of regulating factors are testable under controlled conditions, minimizing risk of release into the environment and offering significant advancement on existing testing programmes. Our model addresses folivory but is easily modified for herbivory damaging the seed or directly affecting seed production by infested plants, or for pathogens altering seed survival in the seedbank.

AB Ecological interactions may vary geographically as a function of diversity, density, or per capita interaction strengths, but we know little about the relative importance of these three mechanisms. We examined variation in species richness, abundance, and interactions among leaf-chewing herbivores and the dominant salt-marsh plant Spartina alterniflora along the Atlantic Coast of the United States. High-latitude S. alterniflora plants are more palatable to herbivores than are low-latitude plants. Within this range of latitude, diversity and density of the dominant leaf-chewing consumers, snails and grasshoppers, in Spartina-dominated portions of the marsh varied little. Low-latitude plants, however, experienced much greater levels of leaf damage from consumers than did high-latitude plants. Per capita feeding rates of low-latitude snails (Littoraria irrorata) and grasshoppers (Orchelimum fidicinum) in the laboratory were greater than feeding rates of high-latitude snails (Melampus bidentatus) and grasshoppers (Conocephalus spartinae). In field experiments, low-latitude snails strongly suppressed S. alterniflora growth, but high-latitude snails had no effect on primary production. Thus, latitudinal differences in the effect of herbivores on plants (i.e., interaction strength), driven by differences in per capita effects among species, rather than differences in diversity or density, may contribute to selection for latitudinal differences in plant palatability. Because geographical differences in interaction strength can occur in the absence of differences in diversity or density, linking biogeography with community ecology will require experimental studies that explicitly measure interaction strength at multiple geographic locations.

AB 1. Recent studies have evaluated the distribution of specialization in species interaction networks. Species abundance patterns have been hypothesized to determine observed topological patterns. We evaluate this hypothesis in the context of host-parasite interaction networks.
   2. We used two independent series of data sets, one consisting of data for seven sites describing interactions between freshwater fish and their metazoan parasites and another consisting of data for 25 localities describing interactions between fleas and their mammalian hosts. We evaluated the influence of species abundance patterns on the distribution of specialization in these host-parasite interaction networks with the aid of null models.
   3. In parallel with recent studies of plant-animal mutualistic networks, our analyses suggest that host-parasite interactions in these systems are highly asymmetric: specialist parasites tend to interact with hosts with high parasite richness, whereas hosts with low parasite richness tend to interact mainly with generalist parasites.
   4. The observed distribution of specialization was predicted by a null model that assumed that species-specific probabilities of being assigned a link during the randomization process were roughly proportional to their relative abundance. Thus, abundant hosts tend to harbour richer parasite faunas, with a high proportion of rare specialists.

AB We use genetic divergence at 16 microsatellite loci to investigate how geographical features of the Galapagos landscape structure island populations of Darwin's finches. We compare the three most genetically divergent groups of Darwin's finches comprising morphologically and ecologically similar allopatric populations: the cactus finches (Geospiza scandens and Geospiza conirostris), the sharp-beaked ground finches (Geospiza difficilis) and the warbler finches (Certhidea olivacea and Certhidea fusca). Evidence of reduced genetic diversity due to drift was limited to warbler finches on small, peripheral islands. Evidence of low levels of recent interisland migration was widespread throughout all three groups. The hypothesis of distance-limited dispersal received the strongest support in cactus and sharp-beaked ground finches as evidenced by patterns of isolation by distance, while warbler finches showed a weaker relationship. Support for the hypothesis that gene flow constrains morphological divergence was only found in one of eight comparisons within these groups. Among warbler finches, genetic divergence was relatively high while phenotypic divergence was low, implicating stabilizing selection rather than constraint due to gene flow. We conclude that the adaptive radiation of Darwin's finches has occurred in the presence of ongoing but low levels of gene flow caused by distance-dependent interisland dispersal. Gene flow does not constrain phenotypic divergence, but may augment genetic variation and facilitate evolution due to natural selection. Both microsatellites and mtDNA agree in that subsets of peripheral populations of two older groups are genetically more similar to other species that underwent dramatic morphological change. The apparent decoupling of morphological and molecular evolution may be accounted for by a modification of Lack ' s two-stage model of speciation: relative ecological stasis in allopatry followed by secondary contact, ecological interactions and asymmetric phenotypic divergence.

ID IDENTIFICATION
AB We document the isolation and characterization of 23 microsatellite DNA markers for the endangered Kirtland's warbler (Dendroica kirtlandii), a Nearctic/Neotropical migrant passerine. This suite of markers revealed moderate to high levels of allelic diversity (averaging 7.7 alleles per locus) and heterozygosity (averaging 72%). Genotypic frequencies at 22 of 23 (95%) markers conformed to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium expectations, and no linkage disequilibrium was observed in blood samples taken from 14 warblers found on the wintering grounds in the Bahamas archipelago. Multilocus genotypes resulting from this suite of markers should reduce the amount of resources required for initiating new genetic studies assessing breeding structure, parentage, demographics, and individual-level ecological interactions for D. kirtlandii.

AB Functional groups with diverse responses to environmental factors sum to produce communities with less temporal variability in their biomass than those lacking this diversity. The detection of these compensatory dynamics can be complicated by a spatio-temporal alternation in the environmental factors limiting growth (both abiotic and biotic), which restricts the occurrence of compensatory dynamics to certain periods or locations. Hence, resolving the spatio-temporal scale may uncover important spatial and/or temporal components in community variability. Using long-term data from Lake Constance (Bodensee), we find that a reduction in grazing pressure and relaxed competition for nutrients during winter and spring generates coherent dynamics among edible and less edible phytoplankton. During summer and fall, when both grazing pressure and nutrient limitation are present, edible and less edible phytoplankton exhibit compensatory dynamics. This study supports recent work suggesting that both abiotic and biotic interactions promote compensatory dynamics and to our knowledge, this is the first example of a system where compensatory and coherent dynamics seasonally alternate.

AB Wetlands are abundant throughout the prairie pothole region (PPR), an area comprising over 700,000 km(2) in central North America. Prairie wetland communities are strongly influenced by regional physiography and climate, resulting in extreme spatial and temporal variability relative to other aquatic ecosystems. Given the strong influence of abiotic factors, PPR wetland communities have been viewed traditionally in the context of their responses to chemical and physical features of landscape and climate. Although useful, this physical-chemical paradigm may fail to account for ecosystem variability due to biotic influences, particularly those associated with presence of fish. Spatial and temporal variability in fish populations, in turn, may reflect anthropogenic activities, landscape characteristics, and climate-mediated effects on water levels, surface connectivity, and hydroperiods. We reviewed studies assessing influences of fish on prairie wetlands and examined precipitation patterns and biological data from PPR wetlands in east-central North Dakota and western Minnesota, USA. Our review and analysis indicated that native fish influence many characteristics of permanently flooded prairie wetlands, including water clarity and abundance of phytoplankton, submerged macrophytes, and aquatic invertebrates. We suggest that ecologists and managers will benefit from conceptual paradigms that better meld biotic interactions associated with fish, and perhaps other organisms, with chemical and physical influences on prairie wetland communities.

TI Elephant Loxodonta africana driven woodland conversion to shrubland
   improves dry-season browse availability for impalas Aepyceros melampus

AB Along the Chobe Riverfront in northern Botswana, elephants Loxodonta africana have reduced woodland cover and modified woody species composition, forming shrublands. We tested the hypothesis that this has favoured the impala Aepyceros melampus population and contributed to the observed population increase by creating more available dry-season browse. Our results suggest that the increasing Capparis shrubland represents a key browsing habitat. The mixed Combretum shrubland was a less important browsing habitat, as female impalas browsed proportionally to the time spent feeding, but this habitat has more than doubled in extent, to almost 60% since 1962, thus providing much more available browse. The Baikiaea woodland, which has declined to less than half of its extent during 1962-1998 mainly due to elephant impacts, provided the least amount of dry-season browse for impalas. Impalas browsed mostly below 70 cm and conversion of woodland to shrubland has increased the availability of browse at this height. Our study suggests a three-way ecological interaction, with elephants changing the vegetation, and impalas increasing in number due to greater food availability.

AB Species interactions and connectivity are both central to explaining the stability of ecological communities and the problem of species extinction. Yet, the role of species interactions for the stability of spatially subdivided communities still eludes ecologists. Ecological models currently address the problem of stability by exploring the role of interaction strength in well mixed habitats, or of connectivity in subdivided communities. Here I propose a unification of interaction strength and connectivity as mechanisms explaining regional community stability. I introduce a metacommunity model based on succession dynamics in coastal ecosystems, incorporating limited dispersal and facilitative interactions. I report a sharp transition in regional stability and extinction probability at intermediate interaction strength, shown to correspond to a phase transition that generates scale-invariant distribution and high regional stability. In contrast with previous studies, stability results from intermediate interaction strength only in subdivided communities, and is associated with large-scale (scale-invariant) synchrony. These results can be generalized to other systems exhibiting phase transitions to show how local interaction strength can be used to resolve the link between regional community stability and pattern formation.

AB Traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) represents multiple bodies of knowledge accumulated through many generations of close interactions between people and the natural world. TEK and its application via customary ecological management plans can be useful in modern conservation programs. I disaggregate the term TEK into its constituent parts and show several ways in which TEK can strengthen research designs by increasing locality-specific knowledge, including environmental linkages occurring in those localities. Examples of the uses of TEK in conservation include folk taxonomy in systematics in Micronesia, species knowledge for conservation in Kiribati, and fishers' knowledge of ecological interactions for reserve design in Belize. When conservationists recognize the utility of TEK, they can engage in an equitable exchange of knowledge and foster shared responsibility with indigenous people. These types of exchanges can also provide an opportunity for indigenous people to develop a scientific infrastructure.

AB We examined the relative roles of biotic resistance and abiotic factors in controlling the establishment and early survival of an invasive marine grass, Spartina anglica, in the Pacific Northwest. S. anglica can invade diverse estuarine habitats, including established salt marshes, mudflats, and cobble beaches; these vary in native species assemblages and in abiotic conditions, especially sediment salinity, water content, and composition. In four habitat types in northern Puget Sound, we conducted a seed addition experiment to quantify germination and early growth. In vegetated habitats we also manipulated plant neighbors. Seed germination and early growth varied with habitat and zone, but physical factors played a more important role than species interactions. Seedlings in low-salinity marshes and mudflats grew almost 10 times larger than those,in coarse-grained or high-salinity habitats. Patterns of seedling persistence among habitats matched those of natural seedling abundances and mirrored the degree of invasion in different habitat types in the region. The lack of biotic resistance may be due to the stressful nature of saline systems or the lack of species that can compete with or consume the invader. In such systems, managers should focus on how physical vulnerabilities of the habitat can provide invasion "windows of opportunity."

AB Alpine and arctic ecosystems may be particularly vulnerable to climate change. We know little about alpine plant community responses to the predicted abiotic changes, or to possible changes in the biotic environment caused by climate change. Four years of experimental warming and nutrient addition altered dominance hierarchies, community structure, and diversity of an alpine biodiversity hotspot in south Norway. The previously dominant dwarf shrub Dryas octopetala was replaced by graminoids and forbs under nutrient addition and warming with nutrients. Community diversity declined due to decreased bryophyte and lichen richness and abundances, and dwarf shrub abundances. In controls and in plots with only warming, where Dryas maintained dominance, the relationships between changes in Dryas cover and changes in community parameters were negative, suggesting that Dryas controls community processes. Under nutrient addition, bryophyte and lichen diversity decreased with decreasing Dryas cover, probably due to increased competition from graminoids and forbs. The shift in dominance hierarchies changed community structure and dynamics through increased biomass, vegetation height, and competition for light. Community diversity dropped primarily because changes in the abiotic environment modified biotic interactions, highlighting that species interaction must be considered in climate change experiments and in models predicting climate change effects.

AB Mutualisins are inserted in a network of direct and indirect biotic interactions built within the framework imposed by the abiotic setting. We carried out an experiment to test how the availability of light and nutrients modulates the interaction strength between Inga vera (Mimosoideae), a Neotropical extrafloral-nectary-bearing plant, and its associated ants. From July 2001 to July 2003, 48 plants were grown in an old-field site following a three-factor randomized blocked design where treatments were: ant (ants present and absent), nutrient (without and with nutrient addition), and light (sun and shade). During the experiment, in the absence of ants, plants growing in sunlight were shorter, developed fewer leaves and leaflets, were more damaged by herbivores, had half the total dry biomass, and died more frequently than plants visited by ants. In contrast, ants had no effect on the growth, survival, and total biomass of shaded plants. Therefore small-scale heterogeneity in the light environment turned mutualism (+,+) into commensalism (+,0). This study demonstrates experimentally that the outcome of mutualistic interactions can be conditional upon the abiotic setting.

AB The arboreal ant communities of a primary lowland rain forest and three differently disturbed forests that lie close together forming an anthropogenic disturbance gradient were collected with insecticide fogging. Combined samples from all trees (87 foggings) comprised 153,504 ants sorted to 331 morphospecies. The primary forest ant fauna was characterized by high species richness and 53 foggings were necessary to collect communities representatively. Another 63 species of ants were found in the disturbed forests indicating a large regional species pool that might exceed 420 species of arboreal ants. Anthropogenic disturbance caused a change in the taxonomic composition, diversity and structure of ant communities. Community size was a predictor of species richness in the severely disturbed forest types but not in the old secondary or primary forest. Ant abundance had declined significantly in the disturbed forests and only 10% of the primary forest's species were collected in the most disturbed forest type. In each of the secondary forests a change in the frequency distribution of species was observed and a small number of species had gained numerical dominance. Analysis of species associations indicates that the strength of species interactions changed with the degree of forest disturbance. These changes were still clearly recognizable after 40 years of forest regeneration despite optimal conditions for colonization from the adjacent primary forest, demonstrating that the time scale needed for forest recovery after anthropogenic disturbance is very long.

AB 1. Biotic interaction between the ciliate Cyclidium glaucoma and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans was investigated by manipulating the densities of the organisms in microcosms with and without sediment.
   2. After 11 days the abundance of ciliates, nematodes and bacteria as well as extracellular enzyme activity were determined. Ciliates had a negative effect on nematode abundance in microcosms without sediment and in microcosms with sandy sediment, whereas in muddy sediment the effect was less distinctive. An effect of nematodes on ciliates was not observed.
   3. The common resource bacteria were not affected negatively by the activity of the grazers. Overall grazer biomass increased with the addition of sediment to the microcosms, suggesting a rise of the carrying capacity in the experimental system. Especially in muddy sediment the abundance of bacteria and extracellular enzyme activity was higher compared to the microcosms without sediment.
   4. The results of the experiment suggest a strong interspecific competition between nematodes and ciliates, where nematodes are, at least temporary, strongly affected.

AB 1. Exotic invasive species modify natural food webs in a way frequently hard to predict. In several aquatic environments in Brazil the introduction of Oreochromis niloticus (tilapia) was followed by changes in water quality. Yet, because of its rapid and easy growth, this fish has been used in many aquaculture programmes around the country.
   2. To measure the effects of tilapia on the phytoplankton community and on water conditions of a large tropical reservoir in south-eastern Brazil (Furnas Reservoir), we performed two in situ experiments using three controls (no fish) and three tilapia enclosures (high fish density). Abiotic and biotic parameters were measured at 4 day intervals for 28 days.
   3. Fish presence increased nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) availability (ammonium 260 and 70% mean increase - first and second experiment; and total phosphorus 540 and 270% mean increase) via excretion. Nutrient recycling by fish can thus be significant in the nutrient dynamics of the reservoir. The higher chlorophyll a concentration in the experimental fish tanks (86 and 34 mu g L-1, first and second experiment, respectively) was the result of a positive bottom-up effect on the phytoplankton community (approximately 2 mu g L-1 in the reservoir and control tank).
   4. Because tilapia feed selectively on large algae (mainly cyanobacteria and diatoms), several small-sized or mucilaginous colonial chlorophyceans proliferated at the end of the experiments. Thus, the trophic cascade revealed strong influences on algal composition as well as on biomass.
   5. Tilapia can contribute to the eutrophication of a waterbody by both top-down and bottom-up forces. In particular, by supplying considerable amount of nutrients it promotes the increase of fast growing algae. Tilapia must be used cautiously in aquaculture to avoid unexpected environmental degradation.

AB Models of community regulation commonly incorporate gradients of disturbance inversely related to the role of biotic interactions in regulating intermediate trophic levels. Higher trophic-level organisms are predicted to be more strongly limited by intermediate levels of disturbance than are the organisms they consume. We used a manipulation of the frequency of hydrological disturbance in an intervention analysis to examine its effects on small-fish communities in the Everglades, USA. From 1978 to 2002, we monitored fishes at one long-hydroperiod (average 350 days) and at one short-hydroperiod (average 259 days; monitoring started here in 1985) site. At a third site, managers intervened in 1985 to diminish the frequency and duration of marsh drying. By the late 1990s, the successional dynamics of density and relative abundance at the intervention site converged on those of the long-hydroperiod site. Community change was manifested over 3 to 5 years following a dry-down if a site remained inundated; the number of days since the most recent drying event and length of the preceding dry period were useful for predicting population dynamics. Community dissimilarity was positively correlated with the time since last dry. Community dynamics resulted from change in the relative abundance of three groups of species linked by life-history responses to drought. Drought frequency and intensity covaried in response to hydrological manipulation at the landscape scale; community-level successional dynamics converged on a relatively small range of species compositions when drought return-time extended beyond 4 years. The density of small fishes increased with diminution of drought frequency, consistent with disturbance-limited community structure; less-frequent drying than experienced in this study (i.e., longer return times) yields predator-dominated regulation of small-fish communities in some parts of the Everglades.

AB Predators can reduce prey density through consumption and induce changes in the phenotypes of surviving prey (e.g. their behavior, morphology, life history). Recent reviews have highlighted the importance of both types of effects for understanding species interactions in food webs. However, most studies focus on only density or trait effects-few have examined both within a single predator-prey system. Here I examine both the density and trait effects of egg-stage predators of the East African reed frog, Hyperolius spinigularis, a species with arboreal clutches and aquatic larvae. To quantify the density effects of egg predators, I monitored seasonal clutch production and survivorship over two breeding seasons and thus estimated the effects of different predators on larval input into the aquatic habitat. I also quantified the effects of egg predators on the timing of hatching and hatchling phenotype. The reed frog, Afrixalus fornasini, and the ephydrid fly, Typopsilopa sp., caused most of the mortality of H. spinigularis eggs, so I focused on these two predators. Egg predation reduced larval densities from 18 to 82% depending upon the time of the season. Predation by Afrixalus and Typopsilopa caused surviving embryos to hatch 3-4 days earlier, at an earlier developmental stage, and at sizes that were 20-30% smaller compared to hatchlings from undisturbed clutches. Recent experimental studies in this system have demonstrated that reductions in larval density and size due to egg-stage predators facilitate larval survival in the presence of aquatic predators. Reductions in larval density increase larval survival by reducing larval competition and increasing growth through vulnerable size classes. Predator-induced early-hatched tadpoles exhibited higher larval growth rates than tadpoles from undisturbed clutches, and thus realized higher survival by growing more rapidly though vulnerable size classes. Thus both the density and trait effects of egg-stage predators have important, sometimes unexpected, consequences for survival in subsequent life-stages.

AB The effects of pollination competition between related species on pollen limitation, selfing ability and heterospecific incompatibility were studied in the alpine snowbed shrubs, Phyllodoce caerulea and Phyllodoce aleutica (Ericaceae) along local snowmelt gradients. The flowering season of these species highly overlapped and they shared the same method of pollination (via bumblebees). The floral density and nectar production were higher in P. caerulea in the early snowmelt habitat, but they were higher in P. aleutica in the late snowmelt habitat, reflecting the species-specific sensitivity to a short growing season. Bumblebee preference shifted from P. caerulea to P. aleutica along the snowmelt gradient, reflecting the changes in the relative reward level between the species. The extent of pollen limitation of P. caeruea was severe in the late snowmelt habitat, whereas that of P. aleutica was obvious in the early snowmelt habitat. A pollination experiment revealed that P. caerulea showed a consistently low selfing ability, whereas P. aleutica showed a high selfing ability in the early snowmelt habitat and shifted to an obligate outcrosser in the late snowmelt habitat. The frequency of interspecific bumblebee movement for P. caerulea from P. aleutica increased in the late snowmelt habitat. To the contrary, the frequency of interspecific movement for P. aleutica from P. caerulea decreased along the snowmelt gradient. P. caerulea did not indicate heterospecific incompatibility to P. aleutica pollen. In contrast, P. aleutica indicated heterospecific incompatibility to P. caerulea pollen, reflecting the high risk of receiving heterospecific pollen as a result of interspecific bumblebee movement. However, heterospecific compatibility of P. aleutica disappeared in the late snowmelt habitat, where the risk of heterospecific pollen receipt was low. Therefore, changes in interspecific bumblebee movement might have been responsible for the variation in heterospecific incompatibility among P. aleutica populations. The local snowmelt gradient creates diverse biological interactions and mating system evolution in the alpine ecosystem.

AB Interspecific interactions are an inescapable reality in nature. The evolution of a species is largely determined by the environment, abiotic or biotic, in which selection occurs. Quantifying the magnitude of selection is crucial to understanding which aspects of the environment are important to the evolution of a species. Such knowledge is particularly important to fields such as conservation biology, which attempts to maintain a suitable environment for the prosperity of a species, or coevolution, where dynamics are determined by the strength of reciprocal selection between species. I present a general method by which selection due to interspecific interactions may be quantified. This technique is based on past quantitative genetic models of selection and can be used with other methodologies that build on these standard models. The approach may be expanded to account for n-species interactions ( e. g., a plant with two pollinators). Simulation studies conducted using this method indicate that the magnitude of selection between two species is strongly correlated with the presence of nonrandom interactions.

AB Pathogens that infect multiple hosts are commonly transmitted by vectors, and their transmission rate is often thought to depend on the proportion of hosts or vectors infected (i.e., frequency dependence). A model of a two-host, one-pathogen system with frequency-dependent transmission is used to investigate how sharing a pathogen with an alternative host influences pathogen-mediated extinction. The results show that if there is frequency-dependent transmission, a host can be rescued from pathogen-mediated extinction by the presence of a second host with which it shares a pathogen. The study provides an important conceptual counter-example to the idea that shared pathogens necessarily result in apparent competition by showing that shared pathogens can mediate apparent mutualism. We distinguish two types of dilution effect (pathogen reduction with increasing host diversity), each resulting from different underlying pathogen transmission processes and host density effects. These results have important consequences for understanding the role of pathogens in species interactions and in maintaining host species diversity.

AB With the advent of DNA-based molecular technologies, microbial ecologists now have the tools to test whether general ecological patterns apply to microorganisms. In this study, we selected 11 high-mountain lakes from Sierra Nevada (Spain) to test the predictions of island-biogeography theory in relation to ecosystem size and isolation, and to assess the influence of other factors (i.e., ecosystem productivity, resource richness, and biotic interactions) on bacterial community structure. Bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs), generated by denaturing-gradient gel electrophoresis of polymerase chain-reaction-amplified 16S rRNA genes, were used as a surrogate of predominant "biodiversity units." OTU composition among lakes was heterogeneous, and the number of site-specific OTUs was near 50%. Lake remoteness did not affect the number of bacterial OTUs although the spatial distribution of the lakes significantly influenced bacterial composition. Lakes that were closer together had more similar bacterial fingerprints. We found a consistent positive association between bacterial OTU richness and lake area. The slope of this relationship (0.161 +/- 0.026, including literature data) was similar to slopes obtained for organisms with high dispersion rates.

AB Integrating how habitat heterogeneity influences food web dynamics is critical to enhance our understanding of community structure. This study quantified resident (invertebrates) and transient (juvenile and piscivorous fish) fauna within restored intertidal oyster reefs and analogous control sites without reef habitat in each of three habitats (on the edge of salt marsh away from seagrass, on mudflats isolated from vegetated structures, and in between seagrass and salt marsh habitat). Reefs enhanced the abundance of resident invertebrates (e.g., polychaetes, nemerteans, epibenthic anemones, bivalves, and resident decapods) that comprise > 90% of juvenile fish prey biomass. However, the increase in food availability due to reef presence did not affect abundance of juvenile fish in either of the vegetated habitats, suggesting that resources may not limit juvenile fish when restored in these habitats. Only mudflat reefs augmented juvenile fish abundances, most likely due to a combination of greater resource availability and relative isolation from functionally equivalent habitats. In addition, lower abundances of piscivorous fish in mudflat reefs relative to control areas likely contributed to this pattern. Thus, community structure and important ecosystem functions such as secondary production depend on the spatial configuration of surrounding habitats, in much the same way that species interactions can depend on their biotic and abiotic context.

AB The traditional emphasis in ecology on local species interactions has recently broadened to include landscape-level processes. I used data from a seven-year survey of ponds in northern Switzerland to judge the relative contributions of local and landscape influences to the occurrence and density of larvae of eight amphibian species. Each pond was sampled twice each year using pipe samples and dip nets. Analyses evaluated support for a series of alternative models, some suggested by current ideas in aquatic ecology and others designed to reveal the impact of key variables. Results strongly supported models that include both local and landscape covariates. Species differed in preference for permanent or temporary ponds, high- or low-predator ponds, and landscapes within forested or open areas. The occurrence of all species was positively correlated with the densities of other species, suggesting that competition was less important than variation in quality among sites. The results emphasize the importance of local processes in governing the status of populations, because even landscape-level effects were probably caused by availability of habitat during the terrestrial stage, rather than by metapopulation processes.

AB Understanding how resource abundance limits adaptive evolution and influences species interactions is an important step towards developing insight into the role of microevolutionary processes in establishing macroevolutionary patterns. We examined how variation in resource abundance (forest area of lodgepole pine Pinus contorta ssp. latifolia) influenced patterns of co-adaptation and coevolution between red crossbill (Loxia curvirostra complex) and lodgepole pine populations. First, we found that crossbill abundance increased logarithmically as forest area increased in mountain ranges lacking a preemptive competitor (pine squirrels Tamiasciurus hudsonicus). Second, seed defences against predation by crossbills increased with increases in crossbill density, suggesting that seed defences have likely evolved in proportion to the intensity of selection that crossbills exert. Third, the average bill size of crossbill populations increased with increasing seed defences, which implies that crossbill offenses increased with increases in seed defences. The large bill size on the largest range is the result of coevolution with lodgepole pine with this crossbill population perhaps speciating. Local adaptation of crossbill populations on smaller ranges, however, is more likely the result of resident crossbills representing a subset of the potential colonists (phenotypic sorting) than of local evolution. In the smallest range, migration and possibly more frequent extinction likely impede local adaptation and may result in maladaptation.

AB Attitudes towards wild animals are reflected through history in various categorizations of species. For example, changes in the useful-harmful dichotomy of species have affected policy decisions during the long history of organized pest persecution as well as during the much more recent rise of nature conservation. The first hunting legislation in Finland dates back more than 650 years, to times when the country belonged to the Kingdom of Sweden. From those times to the early 20th century various acts of law exhibited a marked variation in placing species into useful and harmful categories. The dichotomy seems to be based upon fundamental ecological interactions between humans and other species. We show that the varying interest in pest persecution as well as important conservation milestones have been associated with contemporary human-animal relations such as the attitudes of decision makers and laymen towards wild animals, and the public awareness of species conservation issues.

AB Competition is often invoked as the cause of plant species loss with increasing system productivity. Experimental results for multispecies assemblages are virtually absent and mathematical models are thus used to explore the relationship between competition and coexistence. Modelling approaches to coexistence and diversity in competitive communities commonly employ Lotka-Volterra-type (LV) models with additive pairwise competitive effects.
   Using pairwise plant competition experiments, we calibrate the LV system and use it to predict plant biomass and coexistence in six three-species and one seven-species experimental mixture. Our results show that five out of the six three-species sets and the seven-species set deviate significantly from LV model predictions. Fitting an additional non-additive competition coefficient resulted in predictions that more closely matched the experimental results, with stable coexistence suggested in all but one case. These results are discussed with particular reference to the possible underlying mechanisms of coexistence in our experimental community. Modelling the effect of competition intensity on stability indicates that if nonadditive effects occur, they will be relevant over a wide range of community sizes. Our findings caution against relying on coexistence predictions based on LV models.

AB Previous studies have suggested that species responded individualistically to the climate change of the last glaciation, expanding and contracting their ranges independently. Consequently, many researchers have concluded that community composition is plastic over time. Here I quantitatively assess changes in community composition over broad timescales and assess the effect of range shifts on community composition. Data on Pleistocene mammal assemblages from the FAUNMAP database were divided into four time periods (preglacial, full glacial, postglacial, and modern). Simulation analyses were designed to determine whether the degree of change in community composition is consistent with independent range shifts, given the distribution of range shifts observed. Results indicate that many of the communities examined in the United States were more similar through time than expected if individual range shifts were completely independent. However, in each time transition examined, there were areas of nonanalogue communities. I conducted sensitivity analyses to explore how the results were affected by the assumptions of the null model. Conclusions about changes in mammalian distributions and community composition are robust with respect to the assumptions of the model. Thus, whether because of biotic interactions or because of common environmental requirements, community structure through time is more complex than previously thought.

AB Edge effects alter biotic interactions and forest regeneration. We investigated whether edge creation affected the seedling community and its interactions with herbivores and leaf-fungal pathogens. In forest edges and interior sites in Chiapas Mexico, we counted all woody seedlings and species (10-100 cm tall) present in 1-m(2) plots, measured their size (height and leaf number), and examined them for the occurrence of herbivory and pathogen damage. We investigated relationships between levels of damage and size, species richness and density. Species composition and biotic damage varied greatly among sites and habitats (edge vs interior). Late-successional species dominated the community, but richness was lower in interior sites and species similarity was greater among edges than among interiors. Nearly all species (95%) present at edges and interiors showed herbivory damage, whereas 76 percent of the species in edge plots and 68 percent in interior plots showed pathogen damage. Although leaf area damaged by herbivores was similar between habitats (average 9.2%), pathogen damage was three times greater in edge plots (1.85%) than in interior plots (0.57%). Size was positively related to biotic damage at both habitats. Relationships between herbivory and pathogen damage and between pathogen damage and leaf number were significant only for edges. Biotic damage was not related to density or species richness. Overall, plant community structure was similar between habitats, but biotic damage was enhanced at edges. Thus, disease spread at edges may arise as a threat to tropical rain forest vegetation.

AB The growth of isolated species can be described by simple laws but the fate of ecosystems, where several species interact, is difficult to predict. A crucial point seems to be the identification of regularities in the species interaction patterns that determine the fate of ecosystems. We approach this problem by using an ecosystem of three species whose populations are governed by generalized Lotka-Volterra differential equations. In our model, the species undergo both inter-specific and intra-specific interactions. The inter-specific interactions are positive, null or negative and are parameterized by interaction coefficients epsilon(ij) which take values: +1, 0 and -1, respectively. In these conditions, 138 different patterns of interactions (up to species re-labeling) are possible. Two extreme cases for the three intra-specific interactions (self-interactions) are considered: epsilon(ii) = -1 and epsilon(ii) = 0. We also define derived parameters, calculated from the interaction coefficients, which are relevant to determine the survival of species. Comparison of particular patterns shows that the relationship between interaction structure and survival can be subtle and, a priori, unexpected. For instance, we found that adding a negative interaction to a given pattern may be detrimental, indifferent or even beneficial. The same may happen when adding a positive interaction. To make a systematic study of the relationship between structure and fate, first, we perform a "microscopic" study based on the analysis of individual patterns. As a result, we obtained certain general rules or "theorems" concerning the extreme cases of coexistence and extinction of the three species. Second, in order to cover intermediate cases, where precise rules could not be found, we performed "statistical" studies. These provide the probability of survival and coexistence of species as a function of the values of the interaction derived parameters. Among other results, we found that reciprocal cyclic structures, of both positive and negative interactions, and evenly distributed sign balances of input interactions to the species appear to favor survival and coexistence.

AB Theoretical models predict that the net outcome of biotic interactions among plants is the sum of co-occurring negative and positive interactions, with facilitation generally increasing in importance with increasing abiotic stress. However, species differ in fundamental niche optima; thus the intensity of stress is relative among species and important only in the context of these relative differences. We tested the hypothesis that the facilitative response of a species is relative to how much abiotic conditions deviate from the optimum conditions for that particular species (stress), and the competitive "response" ability of the species (i.e., its ability to tolerate the inhibitory effects of neighbors). In a field experiment, we examined the responses of three co-occurring species with different ecological optima, Bromus erectus, Brachypodium rupestre, and Arrhenatherum elatius, to the alleviation of a primary limiting resource (water), and to biotic interactions in a mesoxeric grassland in eastern France. We found that A. elatius had a strong positive response to watering, the response of B. rupestre was moderately positive, and B. erectus did not respond significantly, suggesting that water stress was only important for the first two species. Most importantly, the net outcome of the interaction between each species and its neighbors depended on the degree of water stress it experienced in its natural habitat. For survival, in the control plots we found no significant interactions for B. erectus (not stressed) whereas B. rupestre and A. elatius (stressed species) were facilitated. Enhancing water availability suppressed facilitation of B. rupestre and A. elatius and led to competitive exclusion of B. erectus. In contrast to survival, there was no facilitation for growth in the control plots, and competition intensity increased for all three species with watering. In our experiment the competitive response of a species was inverse to its ability to tolerate stress, indicating a trade-off between these components of the species response. A facilitative outcome appears to be a function of a species having both a low tolerance to a particular abiotic stress and a strong competitive-response ability.

AB Positive species interactions have the potential to strongly influence the structure and dynamics of ecological communities, yet surprisingly few studies have documented their general importance. We tested the hypothesis that the mutualistic association between fire ants and aphids enhances the impact of fire ants on the herbivorous and predaceous arthropod community of cotton. We found that the presence of aphids attracted foraging fire ants onto cotton plants. This shift from ground to foliar foraging resulted in more frequent interactions between fire ants and arthropods associated with cotton. The survival of herbivores (caterpillars) and predators (ladybird beetles and lacewings) was lower in the presence of fire ants and aphids compared with fire ants alone in greenhouse experiments. Similarly, fire ants and aphids deterred plant bugs from spending time on cotton foliage. Using large-scale field manipulations of fire ants along with naturally occurring aphid populations, we found that the ant-aphid mutualism accounted for much of the variation underlying ant impact on cotton herbivores and predators. For example, in 2001, similar to 27% of herbivore taxa and 54% of predator taxa were adversely affected by the mutualism. The overall community response, however, was highly conditional with strong temporal variation in the effects of the ant-aphid association. Our results indicate that the relationship between fire ants and aphids serves as a key interaction that alters the structure of cotton arthropod communities. This conclusion has far-reaching significance for understanding food web dynamics in natural systems and the efficacy of biological control in ant-infested areas.

AB Urbanization is one of the most extreme and rapidly growing anthropogenic pressures on the natural world. Urban development has led to substantial fragmentation of areas of natural habitat, resulting in significant impacts on biodiversity and disruptions to ecological processes. We investigated the levels of leaf damage caused by invertebrates in a dominant canopy species in urban remnants in a highly fragmented urban landscape in Sydney, Australia, by assessing the frequency and extent of chewing and surface damage of leaves in urban remnants compared to the edges and interiors of continuous areas of vegetation. Although no difference was detected in the frequency of leaves showing signs of damage at small, edge, and interior sites, small sites suffered significantly greater levels of leaf damage than did interior sites. Trees at edge sites showed intermediate levels of damage, suggesting that edge effects alone are not the cause of higher levels of herbivory. These findings are the first to demonstrate the effects of urbanization on invertebrate damage in dominant trees at coarse scales. This is consistent with hypotheses predicting that changes in species composition through urban fragmentation affect ecological interactions.

AB 1 Vegetation removal manipulations over four growing seasons in an alpine Dryas heath at Finse, south Norway, were used to examine the role of neighbour vegetation in the population dynamics of the forb Thalictrum alpinum and the sedge Carex vaginata. We also increased temperature (by open top chambers) and nutrient availability to assess if effects of surrounding vegetation may be modified by environmental change.
   2 Removal of neighbour vegetation increased the number of leaves of Thalictrum and Carex, whereas flowering stems and leaf stalks of Thalictrum became significantly shorter. Furthermore, increased plant growth after nutrient addition and warming suggests that both abiotic environmental conditions and biotic interactions limit plant growth at Finse.
   3 Our results suggest that there is competition for nutrients at Finse, but that surrounding vegetation may also have facilitative sheltering effects on other species.
   4 Interactions between vegetation removal and abiotic factors on population dynamic parameters of Thalictrum suggest that plant-plant interactions may be modified if temperature and nutrient availability increase under climate change.
   5 The responses of the two target species to the removal of the general neighbour vegetation were less pronounced than their responses to the removal of the dominant Dryas octopetala examined in a previous study. This suggests that one dominant species may affect the population dynamics of other species more than the net effect of all the other species in the community in concert.
   6 Our results show that biotic interactions may affect alpine plant populations and thereby structure alpine plant communities. Furthermore, the effects of neighbours and abiotic environmental changes on alpine plant growth may depend on the species identity of the neighbours.

AB In tropical floodplain rivers, communities associated with structurally complex habitats are disassembled and reassembled as aquatic organisms repeatedly colonize new areas in response to gradual but continuous changes in water level. Thus, a neutral model reflecting random colonization and extinction dynamics may be sufficient to predict assemblage patterns at the scale of local habitat patches. If water level fluctuations and associated patch dynamics are sufficiently predictable, however, community assembly on habitat patches also may be influenced by species-specific responses to habitat features and/or species interactions. We experimentally manipulated structural complexity and proximity to source habitat (which influences colonization rate) of simulated rocky patches in the littoral zone of a tropical lowland river and demonstrate significant effects of both factors on species density of fishes and macro-invertebrates. Interspecific variation in vagility significantly affected assemblage response to habitat complexity. In a second experiment, created habitat patches were sampled over time intervals ranging from 1 day to 36 days to examine temporal dynamics of community assembly. A null-model test revealed that assemblage structure became increasingly non-random, concomitant with increasing species density, over time. Community dynamics in newly formed habitat patches appeared to be dominated by dispersal, whereas in older patches, abundances of individual species increasingly were influenced by habitat characteristics. These data suggest that species-specific responses to environmental variation resulted, in part, because of species interactions. We conclude that community assembly in shallow habitats of this tropical lowland river is influenced by physical habitat characteristics, the spatial distribution of habitat patches, and species interactions as habitats are saturated with individuals.

AB Whether restoration programs successfully reinstate ecological interactions remains a contentious and largely untested issue. We investigated plant and pollinator interactions on two old and two restored hay meadows, with the aim of evaluating if quantitative patterns of insect visitation and pollen transport were comparable among old and restored meadows. In terms of structural diversity, few species of plants and insects were shared among the webs. In all four meadows, Diptera and Hymenoptera dominated the visitor community in terms of both species richness and abundance. Coleoptera, Hemiptera, and Lepidoptera comprised the remainder of the flower visitors. No significant difference was found between restored and old sites in plant or insect species richness or in plant and insect abundance. In terms of function, the meadows appeared more similar, although a slightly higher proportion of the potential links between plants and insects was realized for old meadows. No difference was found in the proportion of plant species visited, and visited plant species were generalized, with all having more than a single species of insect visitor. We also sampled approximately 400,000 pollen grains from the flower-visiting insects. There were no differences between old and restored sites in the amount of pollen being transported or in the average number of pollen grains per insect. At both types of meadows, Hymenoptera carried most pollen, followed by Diptera. Again, generalization was the norm, with all plants having more than a single species of pollen carrier. No difference was observed in the connectance of pollen transport webs between old and restored sites. Overall, although the four meadows showed considerable structural variation, they showed similarity with regard to the functional processes we studied. Because structural variation is expected among localities, we conclude that the two restoration projects have been successful.

AB This study investigated the role of hydrology, soils, and trampling in determining the distribution of vegetation in an isolated wetland from 1996 to 1999. Grassy Pond, in Litchfield, New Hampshire, is a seasonally flooded basin marsh situated in sandy soils. It is a depressional wetland consisting of three connected basins; it has no surface-water inlets or outlets. This acidic, low-nutrient wetland contains several rare species and represents an uncommon ecosystem type in New England. A network of wells and piezometers monitored from 1996 to 1999 established that the wetland receives an average of 95.4% of its growing season inputs from precipitation and the rest from shallow ground water flowing through the wetland; as a result, it experiences large fluctuations in water levels. Vegetation in the wetland fell into five major elevation zones. Variation in plant diversity within each zone, and differences between adjacent zones, result in part from differences in depth of organic layer, trampling by hikers, all-terrain vehicles, and native wildlife, and the extent of water-level fluctuations. Several of the low basin species are more likely to be found in trampled areas. Shrub invasion of the open basin areas is prevented by trampling in some areas and by high water levels in others. Variability in hydrology resulted in temporal, as well as spatial, variability in the plant community, as dry years yielded significantly greater diversity, including a large increase in tree seedlings. Both hydrologic variability and trampling are external factors that explain a significant portion of the variation in vegetation on a large scale and connect this geographically isolated wetland to the surrounding landscape. On a smaller scale, however, autogenic forces related to soil formation and plant species interactions may be more important in explaining the plant diversity in the wetland.

AB Species interactions and their indirect effects on the availability and distribution of resources have been considered strong determinants of community structure in many different ecological systems. In deciduous forests, the presence of overstory trees and shrubs creates a shifting mosaic of resources for understory plants, with implications for their distribution and abundance. Determination of the ultimate resource constraints on understory vegetation may aid management of these systems that have become increasingly susceptible to invasions by non-native plants. Microstegium vimineum (Japanese grass) is an invasive annual grass that has spread rapidly throughout the understory of forests across the eastern United States since it was first observed in Tennessee in 1919. M. vimineum occurs as extensive, dense patches in the understory of eastern deciduous forests, yet these patches often exhibit sharp boundaries and distinct gaps in cover. One example of this distributional pattern was observed relative to the native midstory tree Asimina triloba (pawpaw), whereby dense M. vimineum cover stopped abruptly at the drip line of the A. triloba patch and was absent beneath the A. triloba canopy. We conducted field and greenhouse experiments to test several hypotheses regarding the causes of this observed pattern of M. vimineum distribution, including allelopathy, seed dispersal, light limitations, and soil moisture, texture, and nutrient content. We concluded that light reduction by the A. triloba canopy was the environmental constraint that prevented establishment of M. vimineum beneath this tree. Whereas overstory tree canopy apparently facilitates the establishment of this shade-tolerant grass, the interaction of overstory canopy with midstory canopy interferes with M. vimineum by reducing the availability of sunflecks at the ground layer. It is likely that other midstory species influence the distribution and abundance of other herb-layer species, with implications for management of understory invasive plant species.

AB A central problem for ecology is to understand why some biological invasions succeed while others fail. Species interactions frequently are cited anecdotally for establishment failure, but biotic resistance is not well supported by quantitative experimental studies in animal communities. In a 33-month experiment on Hawaii Island, exclusion of native and alien forest birds resulted in a 25- to 80-fold increase in the density of a single non-indigenous spider species (Theridiidae: Achaearanea cf. riparia). Caged plots held large aggregations of juveniles and more large-bodied individuals, suggesting potential reproductive individuals are more susceptible to bird predation. Most examples of biotic resistance involve competition for limiting resources among sessile marine animals or terrestrial plants. The present results show that generalist predators can limit the success of introductions, even on oceanic islands, generally assumed less resistant to invasion.

AB The role of habitat selection behaviour in the assembly of natural communities is an increasingly important theme in ecology. At the same time, ecologists and conservation biologists are keenly interested in scale and how processes at scales from local to regional interact to determine species distributions and patterns of biodiversity. How important is habitat selection in generating observed patterns of distribution and diversity at multiple spatial scales? In theory, habitat selection in response to interacting species can generate both positive and negative covariances among species distributions and create the potential to link processes of community assembly across multiple scales. Here I demonstrate that habitat selection by treefrogs in response to the distribution of fish predators functions at both the regional scale among localities and the local scale among patches within localities, implicating habitat selection as a critical link between local communities and the regional dynamics of metacommunities in complex landscapes.

AB The dynamics of ecological systems include a bewildering number of biotic interactions that unfold over a vast range of spatial scales. Here, employing simple and general empirical arguments concerning the nature of movement, trophic position and behaviour we outline a general theory concerning the role of space and food web structure on food web stability. We argue that consumers link food webs in space and that this spatial structure combined with relatively rapid behavioural responses by consumers can strongly influence the dynamics of food webs. Employing simple spatially implicit food web models, we show that large mobile consumers are inordinately important in determining the stability, or lack of it, in ecosystems. More specifically, this theory suggests that mobile higher order organisms are potent stabilizers when embedded in a variable, and expansive spatial structure. However, when space is compressed and higher order consumers strongly couple local habitats then mobile consumers can have an inordinate destabilizing effect. Preliminary empirical arguments show consistency with this general theory.

AB We assessed the relation between abundance of desert pupfish, Cyprinodon macularius, and selected biological and physicochemical variables in natural and manmade habitats within the Salton Sea Basin. Field sampling in a natural tributary, Salt Creek, and three agricultural drains captured eight species including pupfish (1.1% of the total catch), the only native species encountered. According to Bray-Curtis resemblance functions, fish species assemblages differed mostly between Salt Creek and the drains (i.e., the three drains had relatively similar species assemblages). Pupfish numbers and environmental variables varied among sites and sample periods. Canonical correlation showed that pupfish abundance was positively correlated with abundance of western mosquitofish, Gambusia affinis, and negatively correlated with abundance of porthole livebearers, Poeciliopsis gracilis, tilapias (Sarotherodon mossambica and Tilapia zillii), longjaw mudsuckers, Gillichthys mirabilis, and mollies (Poecilia latipinnaandPoecilia mexicana). In addition, pupfish abundance was positively correlated with cover, pH, and salinity, and negatively correlated with sediment factor (a measure of sediment grain size) and dissolved oxygen. Pupfish abundance was generally highest in habitats where water quality extremes (especially high pH and salinity, and low dissolved oxygen) seemingly limited the occurrence of nonnative fishes. This study also documented evidence of predation by mudsuckers on pupfish. These findings support the contention of many resource managers that pupfish populations are adversely influenced by ecological interactions with nonnative fishes.

AB 1. Biotic interactions and abiotic suitability are often emphasized as factors influencing invasion success. Here we examine how these factors might interact to affect the competitive performance of invasive Argentine ants (Linepithema humile) in Western Australia.
   2. In standardized bait surveys Argentine ants controlled twice as many baits in the morning (ground temperatures: 18-25 degrees C) compared to the number they controlled in the afternoon (ground temperatures: 30-40 degrees C). Moreover, Argentine ants displaced native ants from baits only in the morning and were, in turn, displaced by native ants only in the afternoon.
   3. We used a factorial field experiment to test the relative importance of interspecific competition (+/-) and ground temperature variation [warm (25 degrees C)/hot (33 degrees C)] as determinants of competitive performance among established colonies of Argentine ants and two species of native Iridomyrmex (I. bicknelli and I. rufoniger suchieri).
   4. We observed a condition-specific competitive asymmetry between I. bicknelli and L. humile. In the absence of each other as competitors, these two species responded to ground temperature variation in an opposite manner. I. bicknelli foraged more actively when ground temperatures were hot, whereas L. humile foraged more actively when ground temperatures were warm. In competition with I. bicknelli, Argentine ants monopolized two-thirds of all baits but controlled more than twice the number of baits under warm conditions than under hot conditions. Iridomyrmex bicknelli dominated 22% of all baits but did so primarily when conditions were hot.
   5. Linepithema humile and I. r. suchieri responded to abiotic variation in a qualitatively similar manner. Both species foraged less actively when ground temperatures were hot than when ground temperatures were warm, but L. humile showed stronger declines when ground temperatures were hot than did I. r. suchieri. In competition with I. r. suchieri, Argentine ants again monopolized two-thirds of all baits.
   6. Our findings suggest that physical conditions unsuitable for L. humile may combine with interspecific competition from native ants that are more tolerant to hot, dry conditions to reduce the extent to which natural areas in Australia become invaded.

AB A model of species interactions based on their use of shared resources was proposed in 1972 by Robert MacArthur and later expanded in an article ( 1980) and a book ( 1982) by David Tilman. This "resource-ratio theory" has been used to make a number of testable predictions about competition and community patterns. We reviewed 1,333 papers that cite Tilman's two publications to determine whether predictions of the resource-ratio theory have been adequately tested and to summarize their general conclusions. Most of the citations do not directly test the theory: only 26 studies provide well-designed tests of one or more predictions, resulting in 42 individual tests of predictions. Most of these tests were conducted in the laboratory or experimental microcosms and used primary producers in freshwater systems. Overall, the predictions of the resource-ratio theory were supported 75% of the time. One of the primary predictions of the model, that species dominance varies with the ratio of resource availabilities, was supported by 13 of 16 tests, but most other predictions have been insufficiently tested. We suggest that more experimental work in a variety of natural systems is seriously needed, especially studies designed to test predictions related to resource supply and consumption rates.

AB Species sharing the same trophic level as mosquito larvae (hereafter, controphic species) may have complex effects on mosquitoes by sharing both predators and food resources. We conducted an outdoor artificial pool experiment to assess the individual and interactive effects of a predator (Anax imperator) and controphic species (primarily Daphnia magna) on larval populations of two common mosquitoes, Culex pipiens and Culiseta longiareolata.
   Controphic species did not significantly affect survival to pupation of C. pipiens but did increase time to metamorphosis and reduce size at metamorphosis. Culex pipiens and D. magna, both primarily filter feeders, probably compete for food resources. Controphic species caused a small reduction (21.9%) in C. longiareolata survival, an unexpected result given that C. longiareolata larvae are thought to be primarily periphyton grazers while D. magna is a filter feeder. Controphic species did not affect C. longareolata time to, or size at, pupation.
   Anax imperator reduced C. longiareolata survival to pupation (78%) and size at pupation (11.5%) while increasing development time in males only (11.3%). Anax imperator caused a smaller (32.4%), but statistically significant, reduction in the number of C. pipiens surviving to the pupal stage but did not significantly affect size at or time to pupation. The predator did not reduce controphic species densities, and controphic species did not result in increased predator growth.
   We predicted that controphic species, by serving as competitors, would result in fewer C. pipiens surviving to pupation in the absence of predators. In the presence of the predator, the negative competitive effect of controphic species would be attenuated by the positive effect of serving as alternative prey. Our results followed this pattern although the predator X controphic species interaction was not statistically significant (P = 0.157). Because previous studies showed that D. magna did not affect predation rates by A. imperator on C. longiareolata larvae, and because controphic species did not have a strong competitive effect, we did not predict and did not find a predator X controphic species interactive effect.

AB Both an individual ' s genotype and environment govern its phenotype, and this phenotype may have extended consequences for species interactions and communities. We examined the importance of plant genotype and environmental factors operating at large (habitat) and small (microhabitat) spatial scales in affecting a multitrophic arthropod community on plants. We planted 926 plants from 14 genotypes of Oenothera biennis into five natural habitats that represent the range of environments in which this plant. locally occurs. Genotypic differences among plants accounted for as much as 41% of the variation in arthropod diversity (Simpson ' s diversity index) and also affected arthropod evenness, richness, abundance, and biomass on individual plants. However, the effects of particular plant genotypes on the arthropod community varied across habitats (i.e., there were significant plant genotype-by-habitat interactions). Plant genotype explained more variation in the arthropod community than did environmental variation among microhabitats, but less variation than habitats, as predicted by the scale-dependent hypothesis. Herbivores and omnivores were more strongly affected by plant genetic variation than predators, consistent with the notion that phytophagous insects undergo stronger reciprocal interactions with plants than do predators. We detected heritable variation in arthropod community variables and the ability for the herbivore community to select on plant traits, suggesting that evolution in O. biennis can lead to changes in the arthropod community. Genetic variation in plant size, architecture, and reproductive phenology were the plant traits most strongly correlated with arthropod community variables. Our results demonstrate that genotype-by-environment interactions are a major determinant of arthropod community structure.

AB To study genetic effects of habitat fragmentation on plant performance and plant response to biotic interactions, we performed a greenhouse study with plants from 27 populations of the common plant Lychnis flos-cuculi differing in size, isolation, and microsatellite heterozygosity. We germinated seeds of 449 plants and grew up to nine offspring per maternal plant in single pots assigned to a factorial competition-by-pathogen infection treatment. We applied competition by sowing seeds of the grass Anthoxanthunt odoratum into half of the pots. Moreover, half of the plants were inoculated with infective sporidia of the anther smut Microbotryum violaceum. Significant variation among populations in most size measures indicated genetic differentiation between populations. Plants from smaller populations developed fewer flowers than plants from larger populations indicating a genetic Allee effect. A decrease in flower number was also observed for populations with decreased microsatellite heterozygosity, suggesting higher inbreeding depression. Competition and pathogen infection reduced plant size independently from one another and independent from the fragmentation of the habitats of plant origin. While pathogen infection increased the total number of flowers per plant, it decreased the number of uninfected flowers per plant. This study demonstrates that even common species are negatively affected by habitat fragmentation. At the same time, it suggests little effect of habitat fragmentation on plant response to experimental competition and pathogen infection.

AB Despite plant secondary metabolites being major determinants of species interactions and ecosystem processes, their role in the maintenance of biodiversity has received little attention. In order to investigate the relationship between chemical and biological diversity in a natural ecosystem, we considered the impact of chemical diversity in individual Scots pine trees (Pinus sylvestris) on species richness of associated ground vegetation. Scots pine trees show substantial genetically determined constitutive variation between individuals in concentrations of a group of secondary metabolites, the monoterpenes. When the monoterpenes of particular trees were assessed individually, there was no relationship with species richness of associated ground flora. However, the chemical diversity of monoterpenes of individual trees was significantly positively associated with the species richness of the ground vegetation beneath each tree, mainly the result of an effect among the non-woody vascular plants. This correlation suggests that the chemical diversity of the ecosystem dominant species has an important role in shaping the biodiversity of the associated plant community. The extent and significance of this effect, and its underlying processes require further investigation.

AB 1. Harvest-related poisoning events are common in tropical streams, yet research on stream recovery has largely been limited to temperate streams and generally does not include any measures of ecosystem function, such as leaf breakdown.
   2. We assessed recovery of a second-order, high-gradient stream draining the Luquillo Experimental Forest, Puerto Rico, 3 months after a chlorine-bleach poisoning event. The illegal poisoning of freshwater shrimps for harvest caused massive mortality of shrimps and dramatic changes in those ecosystem properties influenced by shrimps. We determined recovery potential using an established recovery index and assessed actual recovery by examining whether the poisoned reach returned to conditions resembling an undisturbed upstream reference reach.
   3. Recovery potential was excellent (score = 729 of a possible 729) and can be attributed to nearby sources of organisms for colonisation, the mobility of dominant organisms, unimpaired habitat, rapid flushing and processing of chlorine, and location within a national forest.
   4. Actual recovery was substantial. Comparison of the reference reach with the formerly poisoned reach indicated: (1) complete recovery of xiphocaridid and palaemonid shrimp population abundances, shrimp size distributions, leaf breakdown rates, and abundances of oligochaetes and mayflies on leaves, and (2) only small differences in atyid shrimp abundance and community and ecosystem properties influenced by atyid shrimps (standing stocks of epilithic fine inorganic and organic matter, chlorophyll a, and abundances of chironomids and copepods on leaves).
   5. There was no detectable pattern between any measured variables and distance downstream from the poisoning. However, shrimp size- distributions indicated that the observed recovery may represent a source- sink dynamic, in which the poisoned reach acts as a sink which depletes adult shrimp populations from surrounding undisturbed habitats. Thus, the rapid recovery observed in this study is consistent with results from other field studies of pulse chlorine disturbances, harvest-related fish poisonings, and recovery of freshwater biotic interactions, but it is unlikely to be sustainable if multiple poisonings deplete adult populations to the extent that juvenile recruitment does not offset adult shrimp mortality.

AB Communication signals inducing aggregative behaviour profoundly affect a variety of ecological interactions, partly because they can be exploited by every member of the foodweb. To develop an evolutionary argument for the use of signals inducing aggregative behaviour in animals, the intricate role of aggregation pheromones in the ecology of Drosophila is discussed as a case study. Costs and benefits for the use of aggregation pheromone depend largely on the local characteristics of the environment, they involve various multitrophic interactions, and payoffs and penalties are density dependent. Plasticity in the use of pheromone is predicted and indeed found. For every ecological system, informational cues accompany food web interactions, and this affects the optimal strategy for individuals in their release of and response to such cues.

AB In an age of deepening biodiversity crisis, plant species biological studies integrating ecological and genetic approaches, especially exhaustive studies with a model plant species, are urgently needed for both assessing the present status and implementing effective conservation measures, as a comprehensive understanding of demographic/genetic interactions involved in the vicious cycle of plant population extinction is a prerequisite for any precise prediction regarding plant conservation. In this article, we summarize the major contributions to conservation ecological studies on a heterostylous clonal herb Primula sieboldii, focusing on gene flow and reproductive success, which are dependent on the life-history traits of the species and biological interactions with its effective pollinators, long-tongued bumblebees.

AB Positive interspecific interactions are commonplace, and in recent years ecologists have begun to realize how important they can be in determining community and ecosystem dynamics. It has been predicted that net positive interactions are likely to occur in environments characterized by high abiotic stress. Although empirical field studies have started to support these predictions, little theoretical work has been carried out on the dynamic nature of these effects and their consequences for community structure. We use a simple patch-occupancy model to simulate the dynamics of a pair of species living on an environmental gradient. Each of the species can exist as either a mutualist or a cheater. The results confirm the prediction: a band of mutualists tends to occur in environmental conditions beyond the limits of the cheaters. The region between mutualists and cheaters is interesting: population density here is low. Mutualists periodically occupy this area, but are displaced by cheaters, who themselves go extinct in the absence of the mutualists. Furthermore, the existence of mutualists extends the area occupied by the cheaters, essentially increasing their realized niche. Our approach has considerable potential for improving our understanding of the balance between positive and negative interspecific interactions and for predicting the probable impacts of habitat loss and, climate change on communities dominated by positive interspecific interactions.

AB Because the range boundary is the locale beyond which a taxon fails to persist, it provides a unique opportunity for studying the limits on adaptive evolution. Adaptive constraints on range expansion are perplexing in view of widespread ecotypic differentiation by habitat and region within a species' range (regional adaptation) and rapid evolutionary response to novel environments. In this Study of two parapatric subspecies, Clarkia xantiana ssp. xantiana and C. x. ssp. parviflora, we compared the fitness of population transplants within their native region, in a non-native region within the native range, and in the non-native range to assess whether range expansion might be limited by a greater intensity of selection on colonists of a new range versus a new region within the range. The combined range of the two subspecies spans a west-to-east gradient of declining precipitation in the Sierra Nevada of California, with ssp. xantiana in the west being replaced by ssp. parviflora in the east. Both Subspecies had significantly higher fitness in the native range (range adaptation), whereas regional adaptation was weak and was found only in the predominantly outcrossing ssp. xantiana but was absent in the inbreeding ssp. parviflora. Because selection intensity on transplants was Much stronger in the non-native range relative to non-native regions, there is a larger adaptive barrier to range versus regional expansion. Three of five sequential fitness components accounted for regional and range adaptation, but only one of them, survivorship from germination to flowering, contributed to both. Flower number contributed to regional adaptation in ssp. xantiana and fruit Set (number of fruits per flower) to range adaptation. Differential survivorship of the two taxa or regional Populations of ssp. xantiana in non-native environments was attributable. in part, to biotic interactions, including competition, herbivory, and pollination. For example. low fruit set in ssp. xantiana in the east was likely due to the absence of its principal specialist bee pollinators in ssp. parviflora's range. Thus, convergence on self-fertilization may be necessary for ssp. xantiana to invade ssp. parviflora's range. but the evolution of outcrossing would not be required for ssp. parviflora to invade ssp. xantiana's range.

AB Recent research has generally shown that a small change in the number of species in a food web can have consequences both for community structure and ecosystem processes. However 'change' is not limited to just the number of species in a community, but might include an alteration to such properties as precipitation, nutrient cycling and temperature. How such changes might affect species interactions is important, not just through the presence or absence of interactions, but also because the patterning of interaction strengths among species is intimately associated with community stability. Interaction strengths encompass such properties as feeding rates and assimilation efficiencies, and encapsulate functionally important information with regard to ecosystem processes. Interaction strengths represent the pathways and transfer of energy through an ecosystem. We review the best empirical data available detailing the frequency distribution of interaction strengths in communities. We present the underlying (but consistent) pattern of species interactions and discuss the implications of this patterning. We then examine how such a basic pattern might be affected given various scenarios of 'change' and discuss the consequences for community stability and ecosystem functioning.

AB 1. Consistently very high regional diversity of tropical marine sponges reflects a combination of high within-habitat diversity and distinctness of species composition among habitats. Distinctive sponge faunas of Caribbean coral reefs and mangroves seem to support the assumption that abiotic factors determine sponge diversity within habitats and faunal differences between habitats because these habitats differ greatly in abiotic characteristics and because lower species diversity on mangroves appears to reflect their inferiority as sponge habitat.
   2. A way to test this assumption is provided by unusual mangrove cays in Belize that are inhabited by the typical Caribbean reef sponge fauna. Reciprocal transplant experiments, combined with caging (predator-free space) and artificial substrata (competitor-free space), demonstrated control of community membership by biological interactions for 12 common species: spongivorous predators excluded typical mangrove sponges from reef sponge assemblages, and reef sponges were excluded from mangrove sponge assemblages by competition.
   3. Variation in growth rate was related inversely to variation in defences against predators in the species studied, suggesting a trade-off between resistance to competitors and to predators.
   4. This trade-off influences community structure, as the key importance of competition for space among mangrove species results in lower within-habitat diversity, while multiple challenges, including predation, may maintain high diversity of reef sponges. Differences in species composition between habitats are maintained, as this trade-off precludes success of individual species as members of both faunas.
   5. Most surprising is that typical faunas of mangroves and reefs are not tied to these habitats by abiotic factors. Greater sponge species diversity on the reef does not necessarily indicate superior conditions for sponges. Instead reefs may be a refuge for species that grow too slowly to coexist with typical mangrove species.

AB Invasive species can have large effects on freshwater communities and ecosystems. Potamopyrgus antipodarum, a snail indigenous to New Zealand, has recently colonized North America. We documented the distribution and density of P. antipodarum in the major tributaries of the Madison River in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, examined associations between P. antipodaruin and native macroinvertebrates, and experimentally examined how P. antipodarum affected colonization of substrates by other macroinvertebrates. In 1997 and 1998, we sampled benthic macroinvertebrates in the Madison, Firehole, and Gibbon Rivers and Nez Perce Creek in 3 seasons. 111 1999, we examined colonization of P. antipodarum and other macroinvertebrates in a field experiment using slate tiles in the Madison River. In September 1997, we found P. antipodarum at 23 of 32 locations. Where they were present, P. antipodarum densities ranged from 22 to 299,000 ind./m(2). Densities of P. antipodarum declined between September 1997 and March 1998 and increased between March and July 1998. The composition and structure of native macroinvertebrate assemblages covaried with P. antipodarum densities. Whether the differences in macroinvertebrate communities among sites were related to differences in physical characteristics of streams or to interactions with P antipodaruin was unclear. However, in the field experiment, high densities of P. antipodarum were associated with low colonization of other macroinvertebrates; thus, negative interactions between native macroinvertebrates and P. antipodarum may have the potential to influence the large-scale distribution of other macroinvertebrates.

AB Sensory abilities and preferences exhibited by mobile larvae during their transition to juvenile habitats can establish spatial heterogeneity that drives subsequent species interactions and dynamics of populations. We conducted a series of laboratory and field experiments using coral reef fish larvae (Chromis viridis) to determine: ecological determinants of settlement choice (conspecifics vs. heterospecifics vs. coral substrates); sensory mechanisms (visual, acoustic/vibratory, olfactory) underlying settlement choice; and sensory abilities (effective detection distances of habitat) under field conditions. C. viridis larvae responded positively to visual, acoustic/vibratory, and olfactory cues expressed by conspecifics. Overall, larvae chose compartments of experimental arenas containing conspecifics in 75% of trials, and failed to show any significant directional responses to heterospecifics or coral substrates. In field trials, C. viridis larvae detected reefs containing conspecifics using visual and/or acoustic/vibratory cues at distances < 75 cm; detection distances increased to < 375 cm when olfactory capacity was present (particularly for reefs located up-current). We conducted high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses of seawater containing C. viridis juveniles and isolated high concentrations of several organic compounds. Subsequent laboratory trials demonstrated that C. viridis larvae responded positively to only one of these organic compounds. This compound was characterized by a weak polarity and was detected at 230 nm with a 31-min retention time in HPLC. Overall, our results suggest that fishes may use a range of sensory mechanisms effective over different spatial scales to detect and choose settlement sites, and species-specific cues may play a vital role in establishment of spatial patterns at settlement.

AB The biomass-size spectrum, at ecological scaling of zooplankton community in a fluctuating basin of Emporda Wetlands was analysed by adjustment to a model based on the Pareto distribution. Different shapes of spectra have been related to the availability of resources. Under flooding conditions biomass-size spectra fit better a linear model (Pareto Type 1), whereas in confinement conditions curved shape biomass-size spectra (Pareto Type 11) were more frequent. Results suggest that under flooding conditions competitive and predatory interactions are low and size distributions reflect mainly population growth, especially of small-size organisms. The result is a linear spectrum. On the other hand, during confinement conditions interactions between species would acquire more relevance due to the lack of resources, favouring the displacement of biomass toward larger sizes. The result is a curved spectrum and a decrease of diversity. Thereby, the shape of the biomass-size spectrum is an indicator of the degree of ecological interactions within the zooplankton functional group.

AB Evolutionary ecologists are fundamentally interested in how species interactions affect evolutionary change. We tested the degree to which plant-pollinator interactions affect the frequency of flower color morphs of Raphanus sativus. Petal color in R. sativus is determined by two independently assorting loci, producing four petal colors (yellow, white, pink, and bronze). We assessed the impact of pollinator discrimination on changes in flower color variation by comparing the frequency of colors produced in the presence (open pollination) versus absence (null pollination) of pollinator discrimination. We also assessed the impact of post-pollination and developmental effects on progeny colors using equal pollinations with all four color morphs. Our results from open pollinations found an overrepresentation of yellow progeny in the next generation, when compared with both null pollinations and cumulative ratios based on Hardy-Weinberg and linkage equilibria assumptions. When these results were combined with those from equal pollinations, the overrepresentation of yellow could be attributed to selection from pollinators. Yet, surveys in the field the following year found no flower color frequency changes in the next generation. These results illustrate that flower color micro-evolution can be driven by both pollinator discrimination and other nonpollinator selective forces acting during the seed-to-adult transition, countering selection imposed by pollinators.

AB Coastal marine assemblages are shaped by interactions between physical factors, biological interactions, and almost ubiquitously, human impacts. Large-scale manipulations of human access replicated over a range of physical and biological conditions can generate insights over the processes shaping marine assemblages. We examined the relative roles of human impacts and hydrographic conditions on assemblages of shallow (3-10 m depth) rocky reefs by comparing no-take reserves with fishing areas occurring in gradients of exposure of the coastline to dominant winds and waves around two Mediterranean islands, Capraia and Giannutri, Italy. We hypothesized that fishing influences assemblages directly by reducing populations of target fish species, and indirectly by reducing predation on sea urchins, intensifying herbivory, and causing "barrens" of encrusting coralline algae. We examined how the possible effects of fishing varied with physical exposure of the coastline.
   The composition of fish assemblages differed significantly between sites within no-take reserves and fished reference sites. Abundances and sizes of predatory fishes targeted by local fisheries were greater in no-take reserves than in fished areas. Sea urchin densities, the extent of coralline barrens, and the structure of the algal and invertebrate benthic assemblages showed clear variation associated with exposure of the coastline to dominant winds and waves, but weak effects of protection from human use. Densities of the black sea urchin Arbacia lixula were significantly greater along the windward than along the leeward sides of the islands, and were positively correlated with the extent of coralline barrens. In contrast, the purple sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus was more abundant along the leeward sides of islands and showed indirect responses to protection at Giannutri, where purple sea urchins tended to have greater densities at fished than at protected sites. Protection from fishing influenced fish assemblages directly, and benthic assemblages indirectly, but the latter effect was observed only at sites with lower physical exposure. Indirect effects of fishing and recovery of assemblages within marine protected areas through cascading trophic interactions are likely to vary depending on local physical conditions and on the characteristics of species that are locally dominant.

AB While local processes (e.g., competition, predation, and disturbance) presumably cause species exclusion and thus limit diversity in individual communities, regional processes (e.g., historical events, immigration, and speciation) are assumed to provide a source of species to colonize and thus enrich local communities. Ecologists have attempted to distinguish between these two sets of processes using graphical evidence for local assemblage saturation. However, such efforts have been controversial and are antithetical to the fact that local diversity bears an imprint of both. We examine the local-regional species richness relationship from the perspective of the theory of island biogeography and develop a model that can produce the full range of observed local-regional richness relationships from linear to curvilinear. Importantly, unlike previous models, we do not require species interactions to produce the curvilinear pattern. Curvilinear relationships arise if per-species stochastic extinction rates are substantially higher than colonization rates, while linear relationships result if colonization rates are higher than extinction rates. Because we also show that merely changing the sampling scale can make local-regional relationships appear either saturated or unsaturated, an inference of ecological processes, derived solely from local-regional relationships, is unwarranted.

AB The conceptualization of fragmented populations in terms of metapopulation theory has become standard over the last three decades. It is well known that increases in between-patch migration rates cause more synchronous population fluctuations and that this coherence increases the risk of global metapopulation extinction. Because species' migration rates and the probability of individuals surviving migration events depend on the effective distance between patches, the benefit of improving conservation corridors or the matrix between habitat patches has been questioned. As populations occur in the context of larger communities, moving from a metapopulation to a metacommunity model framework is a natural extension to address the generality of these conclusions. We show how considering a metacommunity can modify the conclusion that decreasing the effective distance between habitat patches (via improving matrix quality or other measures) necessarily increases the degree of metapopulation synchrony. We show that decreases in effective between-patch distance may deter population synchrony because of the simultaneous effect this change has on the migration patterns of other species. These results indicate that species interactions need to be considered when the effect of conservation measures on population synchrony, and ultimately persistence, is addressed.

AB With 18 closely related endemic species that radiated in a diversity of ecological niches, the California surfperches (Embiotocidae) species flock is a good candidate for the study of sympatric speciation. Resource partitioning has been suggested as an important driving force in the radiation of the surfperch family, Within the family, two congeneric sister species, Embiotoca jacksoni and E. lateralis, are known to compete strongly for a preferred single food resource and may be used as a model of ecological interactions for the family. Along the California coast, the distribution of the two species differs. Embiotoca jacksoni has a continuous range, whereas E. lateralis shows a disjunction with a distribution gap in the Southern California Bight. Two hypotheses may explain this disjunct distribution. Ecological competition may have displaced E. lateralis in favor of E. jacksoni. Alternatively, a common vicariant event may have separated the species into northern and southern populations, followed by secondary contact in E. jacksoni but not in E. lateralis. The two hypotheses predict different phylogeographic and demographic signatures. Using a combined phylogeographic and coalescent approach based on mitochondrial control region data, we show that vicariance can only account for a portion of the observed divergences. Our results are compatible with a significant role played by ecological competition in the southern range of the species.

AB 1. In laboratory microcosms, we investigated the influence of diversity of both leaf litter and detritivores on decomposition processes. Either woodlice or earthworms, or a combination of woodlice and earthworms, fed on leaf litter of either oak or alder, or oak and alder for 8 weeks. Mass loss of leaf litter, soil microbial respiration and soil nutrient concentrations were determined every 2 weeks.
   2. For four out of seven decomposition parameters, the joint effects of woodlice and earthworms were stronger than the sum of single-species effects when they had fed on alder litter. When feeding on oak litter, however, woodlice and earthworms together revealed lower decomposition rates than predicted from their single effects. Joint effects of detritivores on decomposition of mixed litter were always lower than predicted from the sum of their effects.
   3. In mixed-litter assays, we obtained intermediate values of decomposition parameters, indicating that doubling the species richness of leaf litter from one to two species did not promote decomposition processes. Effects of mixing litter were, thus, mostly additive; essentially only when earthworms fed on mixed litter we observed, mostly positive, non-additive effects of diverse litter.
   4. Our findings provide evidence for a potential effect on ecosystem functioning through joint action of detritivores even at low species diversity, while litter diversity seems to be less significant. On high-quality litter, isopods and earthworms are not functionally redundant but act synergistically on litter decomposition. The effects of detritivore diversity on ecosystem processes, however, are context-specific and depend on the quality and diversity of the available food sources, and on species-specific characteristics of the detritivores.

AB 1. Adaptive management approaches to ecological restoration are current best practice. The usefulness of such an approach was tested in this study by implementing repeated experiments that examined restoration options for derelict sand mine sites dominated by Imperata cylindrica. Reclamation of degraded land that is dominated by I. cylindrica is a common problem throughout the tropics.
   2. Initially, the hypothesized barrier to regeneration was limited seedling establishment because of I. cylindrica competition. After burning the grassland, woody weed control and planting of seedlings were implemented in factorial combination.
   3. Seedling survival 28 months after planting averaged 26%, with < 1% of all seedlings establishing to a height > 1 m. The hypothesis that a transition barrier comprising solely biotic interactions restricted regeneration of native woody cover was rejected after seedlings and natural regeneration failed to thrive in this experiment.
   4. A revised hypothesis, that the transition barrier comprised a combination of abiotic limitations (soil deficiencies) and biotic interactions (Wallabia bicolor browsing and I. cylindrica competition), was developed. A second experiment tested this hypothesis by removing W. bicolor (fencing), slashing the I. cylindrica, adding organic mulch and planting a mixture of native pioneer and secondary successional woody species in factorial combination.
   5. Seedling survival was 61% in the second experiment and mulching significantly enhanced the survival and growth of all planted species. Planting alone reduced the regeneration of I. cylindrica after slashing. Native woody cover establishment was maximized by planting seedlings in mulched treatments.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Taken together, these experiments support the hypothesis that there is a barrier restricting regeneration of native woody cover, and the barrier probably comprises both abiotic and biotic components. By adopting an adaptive management approach to the ecological restoration of sites, significant insights into their management requirements have been gained, supporting the current best practice restoration framework. Insights gained through monitoring and adaptation will be used to update the reserve plan of management, enhancing restoration of this severely degraded area and promoting connectivity of native woody cover within the conservation estate.

AB 1 I examined the role of species interactions on the population dynamics of the herb Thalictrum alpinum and the sedge Carex vaginata by removing the dwarf shrub Dryas octopetala over four growing seasons at Finse, in the alpine region of south Norway, Furthermore, by increasing temperature (open top chambers) and nutrient availability (nutrient addition), I assessed the effects of climate warming on biotic interactions.
   2 Dryas removal increased the number of Thalictrum and Carex leaves, and flowering frequency of Carex. Flower stems and leaf stalks of Thalictrum, and the leaves of Carex, became significantly shorter following Dryas removal. Warming and nutrient addition increased vegetative plant growth, whereas warming alone had positive effects on sexual reproductive effort of the target species. My results suggest that there is both competition for nutrients, and a facilitative shelter effect of Dryas on its neighbours.
   3 Species interactions affected population dynamics of Thalictrum and Carex. Interactions between the impacts of Dryas removal and abiotic factors on leaf production, suggested that interactions between Dryas and neighbouring species might be modified if temperature and, in particular, nutrient availability increase under global warming.
   4 This study shows that both biotic interactions and abiotic environmental conditions may affect alpine plant population dynamics. Furthermore, it shows that climate change may modify species interactions.
   5 Species interaction effects should be included in climate change experiments and in future models predicting plant community changes under global warming.

AB 1 Competition is widely thought to be responsible for constraining species limits at the favourable ends of freshwater flooding gradients. However, field studies testing this idea rarely consider the role of competition beyond a species' field distribution limits.
   2 To test whether species distributions are, instead, constrained by physiological limits, and only narrowed by biotic interactions, we measured the effect of competition on survival and fecundity of Rumex crispus and Rumex palustris within and above their distribution range along an elevation gradient in a river floodplain.
   3 Flooding reduced the fitness of both species at the lowest elevations. A decline in fitness was also noticed at the two highest elevations in control as well as in removal plots, although standing crop measurements indicated that conditions here were the most favourable.
   4 Both leaf herbivore damage and likeliness of drought increased with elevation. Because herbivore damage only reinforced prevailing abiotic influences, drought appeared to be the strongest constraint at higher positions.
   5 Competition merely narrowed both species' physiological ranges by displacing them downwards from their optimum and maximum elevation. The displacement was strongest for the weak competitor Rumex palustris.
   6 Our study provides experimental field evidence for earlier suggestions that both ends of a species niche can be defined in hydrological terms. It thus indicates that spatial variability in water availability may segregate species niches and thereby promote species richness in plant communities.

TI Plant zonation in low-latitude salt marshes: disentangling the roles of
   flooding, salinity and competition

AB 1 We investigated the factors producing zonation patterns of the dominant plants in south-eastern USA salt marshes where Juncus roemerianus dominates the high marsh, and Spartina alterniflora the middle and low marsh.
   2 Juncus did not occur naturally in the Spartina zone and performed poorly when transplanted there, irrespective of whether neighbours were present or removed, indicating that its lower limit was set by physical stress.
   3 In contrast, although Spartina occurred naturally at low densities in the Juncus zone, it performed well if transplanted there only if neighbours were removed, indicating that its upper limit was set by competition.
   4 Parallel laboratory and field manipulations of flooding, salinity and competition indicated that the lower limit of Juncus was mediated by both flooding and salinity, but not by competition.
   5 The general mechanisms producing zonation patterns of vegetation in coastal salt marshes may be universal, as suggested by previous studies, but the importance of particular factors is likely to vary geographically. In particular, salinity stress probably plays a much more important role in mediating plant zonation patterns at lower latitudes.
   6 Our results suggest that the nature of ecological interactions is likely to vary geographically because of variation in the physical environment, and this variation must be taken into account in order to successfully generalize the results of field studies across geographical scales.

AB Question: What are the grazing effects in the spatial organization and the internal structure of high and low cover patches from a two-phase vegetation mosaic?
   Location: Patagonian steppe, Argentina.
   Methods: We mapped vegetation Under three different grazing conditions: ungrazed, lightly grazed and heavily grazed. We analysed the spatial patterns of the dominant life forms. Also. in each patch type. we determined density, species composition. richness, diversity, size structure and dead biomass of grasses under different grazing conditions.
   Results: The vegetation was spatially organized in a two-phase mosaic. High cover patches resulted from the association of grasses and shrubs and low cover patches were represented by scattered tussock grasses on bare ground. This spatial organization was not affected by grazing, but heavy Grazing changed the grass species involved in high cover patches and reduced the density and cover of grasses in both patch types. Species richness and diversity in high cover patches decreased under grazing conditions, whereas in low cover patches it remained unchanged. Also, the decrease of palatable grasses was steeper in high cover patches than in low cover patches under grazing conditions.
   Conclusions: We suggest that although grazing promotes or inhibits particular species, it does not modify the mosaic structure of Patagonian steppe. The fact that the mosaic remained unchanged after 100 years of grazing suggests that grazing does not compromize population processes involved in maintaining patch structure, including seed dispersal, establishment or biotic interactions among life forms.

AB The effects of grazing by stream invertebrates on algal biomass and spatial heterogeneity were tested experimentally in flow-through microcosms with natural substrates (rocks). One experiment tested the effects of fixed densities of three species of grazers (the caddisfly Allomyia sp. and two mayflies, Epeorus deceptivus and Baetis bicaudatus) on periphyton. Baetis was tested with and without chemical cues from fish predators, which reduced grazer foraging activity to levels similar to the less mobile mayfly (Epeorus). Mean algal biomass (chlorophyll a; chl a) was reduced in grazer treatments compared to ungrazed controls, but there were no differences among grazer treatments. Algal heterogeneity (Morisita index) increased with grazer mobility, with the highest heterogeneity occurring in the Baetis-no fish treatment (most mobile grazer) and the lowest in the caddisfly treatment (most sedentary grazer). A second experiment used a three factorial design, and tested whether initial resource distribution (homogeneous vs. heterogeneous), Baetis density (high vs. low) and fish odor (present vs. absent) affected grazer impact on algal resources. Abundances of Baetis and chl a on individual rocks were recorded to explore the mechanisms responsible for the observed distributions of algae. Initial resource heterogeneity was maintained despite being subjected to grazing. Mean chl a was highest in controls, as in experiment I, and effects of Baetis on algal biomass increased with grazer density. There were no fish effects on algal biomass and no effects of grazer density or fish on algal heterogeneity. At the scale of individual rocks Baetis was unselective when food was homogeneously distributed, but chose high-food rocks when it was heterogeneously distributed. Results of these mechanistic experiments showed that Baetis can track resources at the scale of single rocks; and at moderate densities mobile grazers could potentially maintain periphyton distributions observed in natural streams.

AB The functioning of the plant-mycorrhiza system depends on interactions with other organisms, including saprotrophic (ST) soil fungi. The interactions between mycorrhizal and ST fungi are likely affected by fungivorous soil animals, such as Collembola. In a two-factorial laboratory experiment lasting for 30 weeks we assessed the effects of an arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (Glomus mosseae) and Collembola (Protaphorura fimata, Heteromurus nitidus and Folsomia candida) on the community composition of ST microfungi in soil planted with the invasive grass Cynodon dactylon. The presence of mycorrhiza substantially reduced total plant biomass and reduced N and P availability to the soil microflora, though these effects were less pronounced in the presence of Collembola. The density of Collembola was high (corresponding to about 2x10(5) individuals m(-2)) and was not affected by the presence of G. mosseae. In spite of the large amount of mycorrhizal mycelium in soil, it contributed little to Collembola nutrition. The presence of mycorrhiza strongly affected the community structure of ST soil fungi. In particular, mycorrhiza reduced the relative abundance of Trichoderma harzianum and Exophiala sp., but increased the abundance of Ramichloridium schulzeri and several sterile forms. However, the difference between fungal communities in mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal treatments was much more pronounced in the presence of Collembola. Presumably, the intense grazing by Collembola destabilized the ST fungal community, thereby making it more susceptible to the influence of G. mosseae. These results document for the first time that fungal feeding soil invertebrates can significantly affect the interactions between mycorrhizal fungi and ST soil microorganisms.

AB Density regulation is assumed to be common, but is very rarely tested experimentally. Using annual plant communities, we tested the hypotheses that 1) regulation of abundance in plants occurs at the level of entire communities, not just within species, and 2) such regulation is strongest when resources are most limiting. We transplanted different amounts of seeds from two diverse source communities in Israel to an experimental garden and monitored plant densities and cover for two years under different irrigation regimes. Both total density and total plant cover showed strong evidence of community-level regulation; plots sown at higher than average natural density declined or stayed the same in total abundance over time, while plots sown at lower than average natural density increased in abundance over time. This convergence of community abundance was strongest with the lowest irrigation in both source communities, consistent with the hypothesis of stronger regulation when all resources are more limiting (light levels were high, regardless of irrigation level). The main mechanism of regulation was strong density dependent recruitment, while survival was either density independent or inversely density dependent. Thus, the results also emphasize the need for direct experimental studies of the population dynamic consequences of interactions, as well as of individual level consequences.

AB Recent studies show that ecological interaction networks depart from the "scale-free" topologies observed in many other real world networks. Such a departure has been hypothesized to result from non-matching biological attributes of species, such as phenology or morphology, that prevent the occurrence of certain interactions ("forbidden links"). Here I compare the topology of 17 plant-animal mutualistic networks with that predicted by a simple null model that assumes that a species' degree (number of interspecific interactions) is a function of its frequency of interaction. The topology predicted by this null model is strikingly close to that observed in the real networks. Thus, this null model provides a simple alternative interpretation of patterns observed in ecological interaction networks that does not require the existence of non-matching species traits.

AB Macrophyte mosaics, or tile-like assemblages of turfy marine macroalgae and surfgrass (Phyllospadix scouleri), are persistent and highly diverse along the central Oregon coast. To test the hypothesis that spatial pattern and species abundances are relatively invariant in this system, we studied community structure, disturbance, and species interactions from 1985 to 1990. Abundances and disturbance in permanently marked plots at each of five sites spanning wave-exposed to wave-protected areas were monitored photographically each year. The analysis was spatially explicit, incorporated position effects, and allowed determination of species displacements. To interpret the potential influence of substratum on disturbance, we quantified rock hardness and sediment depth at each site. Field experiments tested the role of grazers and spatial interactions on maintenance of between-patch boundaries.
   Mosaic dynamics varied with wave exposure. At wave-exposed and wave-protected sites, average patterns of abundance and assemblage structure were relatively constant through time, but analysis of transition probabilities showed high rates of change among mosaic elements at wave-exposed sites and low rates of change at wave-protected sites. At wave-exposed sites, most changes involved Phyllospadix displacing neighboring macroalgal turfs but rarely the reverse. At all wave-exposures, surfgrass was the most frequently disturbed mosaic element. Disturbed areas were quickly colonized by macroalgae. At wave-exposed sites, disturbances were closed by regrowth of surfgrass. Disturbance rates were similar across wave-exposures, with wave forces causing most loss at wave-exposed sites and a combination of substratum failure and sediment burial causing most loss at wave-protected sites. At wave-exposed sites, disturbances tended to be larger (436.7 vs. 278.6 cm(2)) but less numerous (228 vs. 484 total disturbances) than at wave-protected sites.
   At wave-exposed sites, surfgrass overgrew all other species except the kelp Lessoniopsis littoralis, which was competitively equivalent to surfgrass. Grazing had no effect on spatial interactions. Disturbance prevented surfgrass monocultures, and with variable dispersal and patchy recruitment, maintained mosaic structure. At wave-protected sites, standoffs were the usual outcome of interactions, and patchiness resulted primarily from colonization of disturbances and subsequent succession. Like mussels, Phyllospadix are simultaneously dominant competitors, the most disturbance-susceptible species, and poor colonizers. These features are shared by theoretical models exploring the processes underlying spatially structured assemblages, and may characterize spatially structured systems in general.

AB The effect of small-scale fragmentation on the above-ground plant biomass was examined in nutrient-poor calcareous grasslands in the northern Swiss Jura mountains in three successive years. In the same field experiment, the fragmentation effect on the below-ground plant biomass was evaluated in I year. Additionally, species richness and abundance of plants were recorded. The experimental set-up consisted of 12 blocks with 48 fragments (24 small, 12 medium and 12 large) and 48 corresponding control plots distributed over three study sites. Fragmentation was maintained by frequently mowing the area between the fragments. Three to 5 years after the beginning of the experiment, plant biomass was harvested in all fragments and control plots in late autumn every year. In general, fragments contained more above- and below-ground plant biomass than control plots. The increase in above-ground plant biomass was partly due to an increased density of plants, and partly due to a change in species composition in fragments. In particular, a competitive shift of dominance towards tall grasses and forbs at the expense of smaller forbs was observed. Beside the main fragmentation effect on above-ground plant biomass, interactive effects with year of investigation, study site and plot size were found. This indicates that the observed fragmentation effect is a combined result of various factors acting to a different extent at different sites and plot sizes. The fragmentation-related increase in plant productivity could affect higher trophic levels such as herbivore and predator communities. (C) 2004 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Attributes of the recipient community may affect the invasion success of arriving non-indigenous organisms. In particular, biotic interactions may enhance the resistance of communities to invasion. Invading organisms typically encounter a novel suite of competitors and predators, and thus their invasiveness may be affected by how they cope with these interactions. Behavioral plasticity may help invaders to respond appropriately to novelty. We examined the behavioral responses of highly invasive mosquitofish to representative novel competitors and predators they might encounter as they spread through North America. We compared the behavior of invasive Gambusia holbrooki and G. affinis to that of two close relatives of lower invasive potential (G. geiseri and G. hispaniolae) in order to elucidate whether responses to novelty related to invasiveness. In short-term assays, female Gambusia were paired with a novel competitor, Pimephales promelas, and a novel predator, Micropterus dolomieu. Behavioral responses were measured in terms of foraging success and efficiency, activity, refuge use, predator inspections, and interspecific aggression. Contrary to a priori predictions, invasive and non-invasive responses to novel interactions did not differ consistently. In response to novel competition, both invasive species increased foraging efficiency, but so did G. geiseri. In response to novel predation, only G. holbrooki decreased consumption and activity and increased refuge use. No antipredator response was observed in G. affinis. We found consistent differences, however, between invasives and non-invasives in foraging behavior. Both in the presence and absence of the competitor and the predator, invasives foraged more efficiently and consumed more prey than non-invasives.

AB Human impacts on the natural environment have reached such proportions that in addition to an 'extinction crisis', we now also face a broader 'biome crisis'. Here we identify the world's terrestrial biomes and, at a finer spatial scale, ecoregions in which biodiversity and ecological function are at greatest risk because of extensive habitat conversion and limited habitat protection. Habitat conversion exceeds habitat protection by a ratio of 8 : 1 in temperate grasslands and Mediterranean biomes, and 10 : 1 in more than 140 ecoregions. These regions include some of the most biologically distinctive, species rich ecosystems on Earth, as well as the last home of many threatened and endangered species. Confronting the biome crisis requires a concerted and comprehensive response aimed at protecting not only species, but the variety of landscapes, ecological interactions, and evolutionary pressures that sustain biodiversity, generate ecosystem services, and evolve new species in the future.

AB In many parts of the world, invasions of woody plants into grassland communities have been attributed to an increase in grazing pressure, which is hypothesized to reduce competitive interactions between grasses and woody seedlings. However, few experimental studies have attempted to determine the importance of the effects of grass clipping (= simulated grazing) on biotic interactions between plant species in the field. In this study we tested the hypothesis that the establishment of Pinus sylvestris and Pinus nigra seedlings would vary with grass clipping and also soil nutrient level, owing to changes in the nature and intensity of biotic interactions. For both Pinus species, we found contrasting effects of the herbaceous cover on seedlings according to the life stage and the nutrient level. The net effects of the herbaceous cover on seedling recruitment rate switched from facilitation to competition with soil fertilization. The soil nutrient level also modified the impact of grass clipping on pine seedlings. On fertilized soils, clipping decreased competition intensity and increased the recruitment of pine seedlings. On non-fertilized soils, clipping decreased Pinus sylvestris recruitment but did not affect Pinus nigra recruitment. In the study area, under natural conditions, the herbaceous cover had a net positive effect on seedling recruitment owing to higher emergence. Grass clipping should not favour pine invasion in the absence of fertilization, but moderate grazing could favour the recruitment of Pinus nigra compared to Pinus sylvestris. Although an exotic species, Pinus nigra had a wider range of favourable conditions for recruitment than Pinus sylvestris. The effects of grazing on woody plant invasion are expected to differ strongly according to grazing intensity, the abiotic conditions, and the target species.

AB Rankings of species-specific juvenile tree growth and survivorship define competitive hierarchies that play a central role in forest dynamics and may also vary in response to herbivory. We conducted an experiment to examine species-specific rankings of sapling growth and survival for six common tree species in temperate forests of the northeastern US as a function of both resource availability and herbivory by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). Juveniles of six tree species were planted in the presence and absence of deer, in high and low light neighbourhoods dominated by each of two different tree species known to both reflect and alter soil resource availability. Under closed canopy conditions, survival and radial growth of most species was low. Under high light conditions, red oak and eastern hemlock saplings inside exclosures grew significantly faster when protected from deer, and eastern hemlock saplings grew faster in red oak- than red maple-dominated neighbourhoods. Browsing significantly decreased survival under high light for all species except beech. Rank order of species-specific growth and survival within treatment combinations changed dramatically. For example, beech saplings had the second highest survivorship under high light / + deer neighbourhoods, but fell to the lowest rank when deer were excluded. These rank-order changes in growth and survivorship indicate that both light availability and herbivory act in concert with gap-phase dynamics to regulate tree population dynamics in eastern deciduous forests.

AB Animal communities on the walls of deep-sea hydrothermal chimneys are distributed in mosaics of patches that may evolve as local environmental conditions change and biological interactions develop. Alvinella pompejana Desbruyeres et Laubier, 1980 is one of the first metazoan colonisers of new surfaces created by mineral precipitation, and therefore may be particularly important in community establishment in active parts of smokers. Here our goal was to investigate the colonisation mechanisms of A. pompejana in new patches and determine whether these mechanisms may influence population structure and reproductive patterns in this species. We deployed a series of TRAC (Titanium Ring for Alvinellid Colonisation) devices at East Pacific Rise (EPR) vent sites to compare the size and stage (i.e. reproductive maturity) distribution of A. pompejana individuals between recently colonised patches (TRACs) and established patches (grabbed by submersible). TRACs deployed for short time periods (11 d to 1 mo) were generally colonised by smaller individuals than those found in background populations or in TRACs deployed for longer time periods (> 1 mo). Colonists into new patches were a mix of juveniles and individuals that were sexually mature but non-reproductive (i.e. not producing gametes), whereas background population and older patches harboured a mixture of individuals at different stages including reproductive females. Although some individuals may have recruited on TRACs as larvae, the major colonisation process involved was probably immigration of post-larval stages. In long-term TRAC, reproductive females were not reproductively synchronised. In this dynamic environment, reproduction would be triggered by the disturbance/migration processes, explaining the heterogeneity observed in reproductive patterns.

AB The dependence of positive species interactions on the traits of individuals has rarely been explored, particularly in marine communities. Therefore, we have little idea about their generality, scales of variability, or reliance on local conditions. Transplant experiments and surveys conducted at 14 sites spanning across similar to 900 km of the central Chilean coast demonstrate that alongshore variation in upwelling, occurring over 10s to 100s of kilometers, explains among-site differences in growth rates of the turf-forming alga Gelidium chilense, which drives predictable landscape patterns in turf height. At upwelling centers, turf algae grew faster and attained taller heights than at warmer downstream locations, where the algal turf remained short because it grew slower and was pruned-back in winter. Replicated, reciprocal transplants of tall and short algal turf, combined with manipulations that controlled predator access to turf, revealed that recruitment of the mussel Perumytilus purpuratus was differentially enhanced by the turf; benefits were strong when the turf was short, but disappeared when the turf was tall. By determining mussel prey supply to higher trophic levels, upwelling-controlled facilitation has important consequences for community regulation. This is the first study to identify upwelling as a physical mechanism generating environmental conditions that (1) control trait-dependent habitat modification and (2) regulate the relative importance of facilitation in marine rocky intertidal communities.

AB Coral reefs and seagrass beds are often located adjacent to one another, but little is known about the degree to which their fish communities are interlinked. To determine whether coral reef fishes on the coral reef are interlinked with or segregated from fishes on adjacent seagrass beds, a 60 m coral reef-seagrass gradient was studied on the island of Zanzibar in the western Indian Ocean. Using underwater visual census, coral reef fishes were surveyed in 4 habitat zones: (1) a coral patch reef, (2) seagrass beds bordering the coral reef, (3) seagrass beds at a 30 m distance from the coral reef edge and (4) seagrass beds at a 60 m distance from the coral reef edge. Based on the densities of juveniles and adults in the 4 zones, the 48 species that were observed were classified into reef-associated species, seagrass-associated species, nursery species, generalists and rare species. Reef-associated species occurred almost exclusively on the coral reef and at the reef-seagrass edge, while seagrass-associated species occurred almost exclusively on the seagrass beds. Generalists and seagrass-associated species occurred in all 3 seagrass zones, but densities of generalists on seagrass beds decreased with increasing distance from the reef, whereas that of seagrass-associated species increased. Reef-associated and generalist species showed an edge effect, where densities on the seagrass beds near the reef edge were higher than on the seagrass beds further away. Juvenile densities of nursery species on seagrass beds also increased with the distance from the reef, whereas their adults showed the highest densities on the coral reef, suggesting a possible ontogenetic shift from the seagrass beds to the reef. The results of the present study show that this seagrass-coral reef landscape features habitat segregation between species and life stages and shows an edge effect, possibly driven by competition mechanisms between species or life stages.

AB Photosynthetic microbial biofilms are an important functional component of rocky intertidal habitats worldwide. The abundance of organisms within these films varies both seasonally and according to vertical emersion gradients. However, the effects of horizontal gradients of wave exposure, which have a key influence on macrobiotic assemblages, have received little attention. Here, we examine the relative importance of exposure to wave action, tidal elevation and season on intertidal microbial assemblages. The abundance of micro-organisms was quantified using counts of major functional groups and total photosynthetic biomass, assessed using extracted chlorophyll. These data were compared between 2 moderately exposed and 2 sheltered shores on replicated sampling dates during summer and winter at 3 tidal levels. Diatoms were approximately 6 times more abundant on moderately exposed shores than on sheltered shores. This pattern was consistent between sites and seasons. The percentage cover of cyanobacteria and total photosynthetic biomass was also typically greater on exposed shores. Seasonal variations were also apparent with a trend of greater photosynthetic microbial biomass during the winter than during the summer. Photosynthetic biomass and, to a lesser extent, the abundance of cyanobacteria were greater on the lower shore than on the upper shore. The possible causes of the differences in microbial assemblages between sheltered and exposed shores are discussed. We suggest that indirect effects of habitat amelioration from macroalgal canopy and grazer density, which also covary along the wave exposure gradient, may be more important than the direct effects of wave action itself.

AB Space is a limiting resource in coral reef communities causing actively growing coral colonies to come in proximity and interact with each other. Although most contact interactions among corals have been studied extensively, very few non-contact and non-aggressive interactions have been documented so far. We present results from a 3 yr field study of coral communities showing that, under unperturbed conditions, the reef-building coral Porites cylindrica exhibits significantly higher growth when transplanted together with 2 other species (P. rus and Pavona frondifera) than when grown in monoculture. However, the introduction of a chronic disturbance (nutrient enrichment) adversely affected its growth rates and survival, thus overturning the earlier trend. Furthermore, the 3 species used in the experiment exhibited different responses to the perturbation (negative, no effect, positive). Our results show that the presence of other species can enhance performance at the colony level, while differential species responses potentially provide buffering effects at the community level that may contribute to the maintenance of community structure and function during periods of disturbance.

Agardh, located on shores about 70 km apart in the northwest Mediterranean. We used transplantation and removal experiments in combination with measures of recruitment to test whether the similarities of patterns between populations, as documented in previous studies, were produced by the same processes. Results pointed to the importance of pre-emption of the substratum in setting both upper and lower margins of distribution of R. verruculosa, Low recruitment contributed to setting lower margins, but did not explain along-shore variation in cover. Intensity of recruitment and post-recruitment mortality were much greater at the northern location in high-shore habitats, whilst fronds attained a larger size at the southern location in low-shore habitats. These data suggested that the processes maintaining the upper and lower margins of distribution of R. verruculosa differed between populations, but produced similar patterns at the 2 locations. Thus, similarity of pattern did not imply that the same underlying processes were operating in different places. Identifying the processes that do not leave signatures in existing conditions, but that may do so if conditions change, can increase our ability to understand and predict spatially and temporally variable patterns in assemblages.

AB Capelin area major component of cod diet in many ecosystems of the North Atlantic. In the Bering Sea, however, the percentage of capelin found in Pacific cod stomachs is negligible. We hypothesize that the landscape (or 'seascape') features of hydrography and bathymetry of the Bering Sea impose a constraint on the distribution of cod and capelin that contributes to their spatial segregation and ultimately, to their uniquely weak trophic link. We analyzed a long-term data collection (1972 to 2001) on Pacific cod and capelin catches and feeding interactions, and developed a new metric to quantify the spatially explicit overlap between a predator and a prey. Our analysis indicates that cod and capelin distributions respond to the thermal conditions of the Bering Sea. Typically, a frigid water mass is present on the middle portion of the shelf, and cod distribution is confined to the southern side of the cold pool, while capelin is confined to the north. However, in warm years the middle shelf is penetrated by thermal gateways (between 1 and 6 degrees C), allowing cod to invade the capelin habitat. In this situation, when cod and capelin overlap, cod feed heavily on capelin. The annual index of cod and capelin overlap is correlated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) index, a climate indicator of the North Pacific. The width of the thermal gateways in the middle shelf is also correlated with the PDO. These results point to a direct causal link, from climate and thermal conditions of the Bering Sea shelf, to cod and capelin distribution, and ultimately to their overlap and trophic interactions.

AB In his seminal 1961 paper 'The paradox of the plankton' Am Nat 95:137-147, G. E. Hutchinson asked why many species of phytoplankton can coexist while competing for a small number of limiting resources in an unstructured habitat. Hutchinson anticipated the resolution of his paradox, recognizing that communities are organized by processes beyond resource competition including species interactions, habitat variability and dispersal. Since 1961 we have made fundamental discoveries that have revolutionized our conceptual understanding of pelagic ecology, including (1) habitat heterogeneity at all scales relevant to plankton population dynamics, (2) community shifts in response to global climate cycles, (3) fast and selective predation as a powerful top-down force to shape phytoplankton communities, (4) turbulent mixing as a physical process that selects species on the basis of their size and form, (5) mixotrophy that allows some algal species to tap organic nutrient pools and function at multiple trophic levels, (6) taxon-specific life cycles including alternating vegetative and resting stages, and (7) the pelagic as an open system where communities are continually reshaped by species immigration. Here we synthesize these discoveries to show how they validate and amplify Hutchinson's hypothesis that phytoplankton communities are assembled by many processes. Our synthesis is built around observations of phytoplankton species composition from a decade of study in San Francisco Bay, used as a case study to illustrate the contemporary principles of phytoplankton community ecology. We apply these principles to address 2 central questions: (1) What processes assemble phytoplankton communities? (2) How does phytoplankton community composition influence ecosystem functions such as production in pelagic and benthic food webs?.

AB Dual-species microbial interactions have been extensively reported for batch and continuous culture environments. However, little research has been performed on dual-species interaction in a biofilm. This research examined the effects of growth rate and substrate concentration on dual-species population densities in batch and biofilm reactors. In addition, the feasibility of using batch reactor kinetics to describe dual-species biofilm interactions was explored. The scope of the research was directed toward creating a dual-species biofilm for the biodegradation of trichloroethylene, but the findings are a significant contribution to the study of dual-species interactions in general. The two bacterial species used were Burkholderia cepacia PR1-pTOM(31c), an aerobic organism capable of constitutively mineralizing trichloroethylene (TCE), and Klebsiella oxytoca, a highly mucoid, facultative anaerobic organism. The substrate concentrations used were different dilutions of a nutrient-rich medium resulting in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations on the order of 30, 70, and 700 mg/L. Presented herein are single- and dual-species population densities and growth rates for these two organisms grown in batch and continuous-flow biofilm reactors. In batch reactors, planktonic growth rates predicted dual-species planktonic species dominance, with the faster-growing organism (K. oxytoca) outcompeting the slower-growing organism (B. cepacia). In a dual-species biofilm, however, dual-species planktonic growth rates did not predict which organism would have the higher dual-species biofilm population density. The relative fraction of each organism in a dual-species biofilm did correlate with substrate concentration, with B. cepacia having a greater proportional density in the dual-species culture with K. oxytoca at low (30 and 70 mg/L DOC) substrate concentrations and K. oxytoca having a greater dual-species population density at a high (700 mg/L DOC) substrate concentration. Results from this research demonstrate the effectiveness of using substrate concentration to control population density in this dual-species biofilm.

ID GENE FLOW; EVOLUTION; DISTRIBUTIONS; LIMITS
AB Biologists have long been fascinated by species' borders, and with good reason. Understanding the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of species' borders may prove to be the key that unlocks new understanding across a wide range of biological phenomena. After all, geographic range limits are a point of entry into understanding the ecological niche and threshold responses to environmental change. Elucidating patterns of gene flow to, and returning from, peripheral populations can provide important insights into the nature of adaptation, speciation and coevolution. Species' borders form natural laboratories for the study of the spatial structure of species interactions. Comparative studies from the center to the margin of species' ranges allow us to explore species' demographic responses along gradients of increasing environmental stress. Range dynamics further permit investigation into invasion dynamics and represent bellwethers for a changing climate. This set of papers explores ecological and evolutionary dynamics of species' borders from diverse empirical and theoretical perspectives.

AB The temporal predictability of soil microarthropod communities in stable forest ecosystems was analysed using data gathered from the literature and original data. Four studies were found with time series of at least five consecutive years; they all reported data on Collembola from temperate forests (as do the original data included). We applied the time tag analysis (regressions of Euclidian distance between communities on time tag) for detecting directional change of community composition, the partial rate autocorrelation function for detecting density dependence, and we regressed standard deviations of the logarithms of abundance on observation period for detecting the colour of the time series. Collembolan communities did not show directional change over time, and the composition of the community appeared to be predictable at a gross qualitative level.: dominant species tend to stay dominant over time. A high degree of density dependence could be detected, which might be responsible for the observed temporal stability of community composition. Intra- and interspecific competition and/or predation may cause deterministic community structure and the results of this study support the increasing body of evidence that Collembola communities are structured by intensive biotic interactions. Collembolan populations did not show any fluctuations characterised by scaling Laws. Either there actually exist point attractors and stable equilibria in Collembola (brought about by non-overcompensating density-dependent interactions), or Collembolan community trajectories are restarted every year by external forces. Due to the large time-scale of environmental. variation in forests, low-frequency noise in Collembola may be recognisable only in time series spanning at least some decades. (C) 2004 Elsevier GmbH.

AB Monitoring multiple species and their interactions at multiple scales is critical for any useful habitat conservation plans and for adaptive ecosystem management programs. Viability of single species can be understood only in the context of ecological interactions with other species at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Here, we present a case study of the spatial and temporal dynamics for two perennial grasses, Bouteloua eriopoda and B. gracilis, by using long-term, high resolution transect data from 1989 to 1998 at two sites in the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge (Deep Well and Five Points) in central New Mexico, USA. Information entropy was used to describe the spatial distribution of each species and the fractal dimension of information entropy was used to characterize the complexity of species dynamics across scales. When considered individually, the spatial distribution of each species was scale-invariant. However, species joint occurrences changed as scale of resolution increased at both sites. Interactions changed at scales less than 3.2 m at Deep Well and less than 1.6 m at Five Points. Across years, the interactions of these species at Deep Well were significantly different in 1989 from all other years. Our results argue that monitoring multiple species at multiple spatial and temporal scales is necessary to better understand multispecies interactions and community dynamics both of which have important conservation implications under changing environmental conditions.

AB Meadow classification studies have demonstrated the importance of water table fluctuation patterns in determining plant community composition in the western United States. However, a mechanism causing an overall increase in Poa pratensis ssp. pratensis populations and local declines in Deschampsia cespitosa populations in western montane meadows over the past century has not been defined. In order to better understand plant species interactions in these often highly grazed systems, we observed aboveground responses of Poa and Deschampsia to changes in species composition, soil moisture gradients, and clipping in the field. As well, we conducted a factorial greenhouse experiment, varying plant density, water availability, and clipping. While Poa is adapted to dry meadows and Deschampsia to wet meadows, their ranges overlap in wet conditions where soil moisture averages 50% in the early growing season. Deschampsia appears to be excluded from dry meadows where Poa is prevalent and soil moisture is closer to 30% water content in the early growing season. Our greenhouse experiment revealed that Deschampsia's competitive ability decreases, while Poa's increases, at soil moistures of 19%. However in more mesic conditions (50% soil moisture), each species aboveground biomass, tillering, and inflorescence weight was adherent to soil moisture conditions, and species interactions were less important. Our early growing season clipping treatments significantly reduced biomass of both grasses, but did not appear to favor one species over the other. This work points to the importance of soil water content in determining the performance of each plant species and the level of species interactions in montane meadows.

AB This paper presents data on temporal and spatial variability and ecological interactions of bacteria in a Scottish woodland over a winter - spring period (January - April). The study sites covered an area of I ha and a range of woodland habitats formed by beech (Fagus silvatica), birch (Betula pendula x pubescens) and oak (Quercus petraea), as well as (one site) a clearance site covered with grass (predominantly Holcus lanatus). Subsamples of fresh litter were fragmented for 60 s in a domestic food processor and were subsequently used to estimate the abundance of bacteria by counting under a fluorescent microscope. The preparation of bacterial slides involved staining with DTAF following extraction in phosphate buffer. The data on protozoa, fungi and microinvertebrates were available from parallel research and were obtained using standard methods. Numbers of bacteria appeared to be lower in sites dominated by beech. The highest average bacterial abundance (9.07 x 10(8) cells g(-1) dry litter) was registered in January, and then gradually declined till March, when the lowest (7.37 x 10(8) cells g(-1) dry litter) value was found, before rising again in April. The only significant difference revealed by one-way ANOVA was between January and March results. Both date and site effects were found to be significant by two-way ANOVA, but the date x site interaction was not significant. A number of significant relationships were registered by stepwise regression analysis, ANCOVA, and correlation analysis. In stepwise regression analysis, the most important predictor for bacterial density was litter moisture content (all months but March). Further significant relationships were revealed with the abundance of fungi, nematodes, and microarthropods, and forest litter fractions of moss, needles, beech seeds and birch leaves. ANCOVA confirmed the importance of interactions with litter composition and moisture content, and the abundance of fungi and microarthropods, and revealed a relationship with the abundance of ciliates. Correlation analysis for separate months revealed various relationships with forest litter composition (including positive - with forest litter fractions of oak leaves, grass, roots, birch leaves, and negative ones - with forest litter fractions of ferns and seeds), and the abundance of other microbiota, including positive with Folsomia candida (Insecta, Apterygota, Collembola), fungi, plant and microbial feeding nematodes, tardigrades and enchytraeids, positive and negative with ciliates, and negative with predatory nematodes. Most of these relationships, plus a further correlation with the abundance of amoebae, were also revealed for the combined dataset. It should be noted that some of these interactions (e.g. with % grass, % roots, the density of Folsomia candida) were only revealed by correlation analysis, and may therefore be judged as less important than relationships registered by all statistical methods applied. The results of this study highlighted the complexity of multivariate interactions of bacteria in forest litter.

AB The non-random dispersal of plant propagules is thought to counter competitive exclusion and thus promote the survival of competitively inferior species. We investigated this process by modelling the outcome of interactions between species with competitive ability defined as a function of both life-history traits and the environment with both random and clustered dispersal strategies and in environmentally homogeneous and heterogeneous environments. Four main results emerged: (1) environmental heterogeneity was seen to promote co-existence in conjunction with associated trait variation for tolerance to the environmental variable and where this trait variation was effectively limited by 'trade-off' such that no single species had an overall competitive advantage, (2) consistent with theory, random dispersal appeared to enhance the likelihood of competitive exclusion, whereas clustering favoured co-existence, (3) the ecological outcome of interactions between dispersal and competitive relationships varied as a function of the trait determining the competitive advantage within a particular environment, and (4) promotion of co-existence by clustered dispersal was most marked when associated with environmental heterogeneity. It is argued that these results suggest that current ecological models of species interactions may need to be modified to incorporate a more realistic understanding of competitive ability if we are to better understand the factors effecting species co-existence.

AB Two related shrubs, Senecio inaequidens and S. pterophorus, both introduced to western Mediterranean Europe from South Africa, were compared with a native Mediterranean shrub, S. malacitanus, to identify life-history traits that confer invasive ability. We examined ecological interactions that affect seedling emergence and establishment, flowering time, growth and reproduction and competitive ability in these three closely related species. Seeds were planted, the seedlings were then transplanted and individual performance was evaluated with respect to: (1) competition with plant neighbours and (2) resource addition. Senecio inaequidens had higher rates of seedling establishment and a shorter pre-reproductive period. Competition with neighbours had a considerable impact on S. malacitanus, delaying flowering time and reducing growth and reproduction. S. pterophorus showed inefficient seedling establishment compared to the other two species, but performed better in terms of growth and reproduction. The two alien species were markedly more competitive than the native one. However, differences in competitiveness among S. malacitanus and the two aliens varied depending on resource availability. Thus, Sellecio inaequidens and S. pterophorus were more affected by competition in subplots with resource addition and by competition in those without addition, respectively. The latter showed a greater capacity to respond to additional resources in competitive environments and, in addition, its reproductive effort was unrelated to habitat conditions. The invasive potential of the alien species was higher than that of the native. This was a result of various biological characteristics and specific interactions between invader and environment, which made the invasiveness of alien species unpredictable. (C) 2004 Elsevier SAS.

AB We evaluated in corm-non-garden experiments the morphological plasticity to shading of three Convolvulus species that occur in Chile and differ in ecological breadth. Convolvulus arvensis L. is a world weed distributed along the country, and is found in open as well as in shaded habitats. Convolvidus chilensis Pets. is a Chilean endemic species typical of coastal habitats, and is found in open to partially open sites. C. demissus choisy occurs only on slopes of the Andes of Chile and Argentina, habitats with high incidence of solar radiation. We hypothesized that the magnitude of phenotypic plasticity to shading of these species would correlate with their ecological breadth. Shading had a significant effect on internode length, petiole length, stem diameter, stem length, number of branches, leaf area, leaf shape, leaf biomass, and specific leaf area. Species differed in all the morphological traits except leaf biomass. A significant Shading x Species interaction in the two-way ANOVA, i.e. differential plasticity to shading of Convolvidus species, was found for petiole length, stem length, number of branches, leaf shape, and specific leaf area. Contrary to our hypothesis, tests of parallelism showed that, in general, the plasticity to shading of C. chilensis (the species of intermediate ecological breadth) was the greatest, and that of C. arvensis (the weed) and C. demissus (the species of narrow distribution) was similar. Issues of ecotype differentiation, in the case of C. arvensis, and the role of life history traits are raised to explain the observed lack of association between ecological breadth and magnitude of phenotypic plasticity.

AB Monitoring is a major component of restoration efforts and adaptive management. But monitoring is often neglected because it can be expensive and time-consuming. Accordingly, it is valuable to determine whether the temporal extent of sampling alters the validity of inferences about the response of diversity measures to environmental variables affected by restoration actions. Non-native species alter ecosystems in undesirable ways, frequently homogenizing flora and fauna and extirpating local populations of native species. In the Mojave Desert, invasion of salt-cedar (Tamarix ramosissima Ledeb.) and human efforts to eradicate salt-cedar have altered vegetation structure, vegetation composition, and some measures of faunal diversity. We examined whether similar inferences about relationships between plants and butterflies in the Muddy River drainage (Nevada, U.S.A.) could have been obtained by sampling less intensively (fewer visits per site over the same period of time) or less extensively (equal frequency of visits but over a more limited period of time). Me also tested whether rank order of butterfly species with respect to occurrence rate (proportion of sites occupied) would be reflected accurately in temporal subsamples. Temporal subsampling did not lead to erroneous inferences about the relative importance of six vegetation-based predictor variables on the species richness of butterflies. Regardless of the temporal scale of sampling, the species composition of butterflies was more similar in sites with similar species composition of plants. The rank order of occurrence of butterfly species in the temporal subsamples was highly correlated with the rank order of species occurrence in the full data set. Thus, similar influences about associations between vegetation and butterflies and about relative occurrence rates of individual species of butterflies could be obtained by less intensive or extensive temporal sampling. If compromises between temporal intensity and extent of sampling must be made, our results suggest that maximizing temporal extent will better capture variation in biotic interactions and species occurrence.

AB Surveys of natural habitats often indicate that native and exotic species richness are positively correlated Lit large scales and negatively correlated at small scales. The small-scale relationship is often presented as evidence that native richness can repel invasion or conversely that exotic invasions can reduce native diversity. The larger scale pattern has been interpreted as evidence of the importance of facilitation, variable habitat quality, propagule supply, and other ecological phenomena. However, these explanations fail to consider expected native-exotic richness relationships under a null model assuming no species interactions. We show via simulation that the null expectation for a randomly assembled community is a negative relationship between native and exotic species richness at the smallest scales and. when plots vary in total richness, a positive relationship at larger Scales. We outline a procedure to compare observational data to this null expectation using, a permutation test of labels of species origin (native or exotic). Our use of this technique on plant community data indicates that patterns of native and exotic richness are remarkably similar to those generated by a null model. We argue that a null model approach is needed to evaluate whether observed native-exotic richness data deviate significantly from expected patterns generated by sampling and statistical artifacts.

AB Ecologists increasingly recognize pathogens as playing significant roles in community dynamics, yet few experimental studies have documented patterns of disease impacts oil natural systems. We studied the effects of a pathogenic fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis) on community interactions between two sympatric North American anurans: Fowler's toad. Bufo fowleri, and the gray treefrog, Hyla chrysoscelis. Recent studies have identified chytridiomycosis as an emerging infections disease, whose widespread occurence poses a significant risk for amphibian populations. We manipulated the presence of B. dendrobatidis in replicated experimental tanks and examined if exposure to this fungus during development could influence recruitment and competitive interactions between larval Bufo and Hyla. Tanks were followed throughout larval development, and we recorded survival. time to metamorphosis. and body mass at metamorphosis. We also tested the effects of competitive and pathogen-mediated stress on developmental stability by measuring fluctuating asymmetry (FA) of surviving metamorphs. B. dendrobatidis had no significant effect on larval survival, but the pathogen reduced metamorphic body mass and increased larval-period length. B. dendrobatidis had different effects oil larval growth depending on the community sructure; in the presence of the pathogen, both Bufo and Hyla metamorphosed at smaller body masses when reared together compared to when reared separately. Bit also had strong negative effects oil Hyla development, but Only in the presence of B. dendrobatidis. FA of hind-limb length was significantly higher for metamorphs front pathogen tanks, but was not associated with density or competitive environment. Our results suggest that chytridiomycosis may impact Bufo and Hyla directly by reducing life-history performance and increasing developmental instability, and indirectly by inducing interspecific competitive effects in mixed-species environments.

AB Broad-scale variation in taxonomic richness is strongly correlated with climate. Many mechanisms have been hypothesized to explain these patterns; however, testable predictions that would distinguish among them have rarely been derived. Here, we examine several prominent hypotheses for climate-richness relationships, deriving and testing predictions based on their hypothesized mechanisms. The 'energy-richness hypothesis' (also called the 'more individuals hypothesis') postulates that more productive areas have more individuals and therefore more species. More productive areas do often have more species, but extant data are not consistent with the expected causal relationship from energy to numbers of individuals to numbers of species. We reject the energy-richness hypothesis in its standard form and consider some proposed modifications. The 'physiological tolerance hypothesis' postulates that richness varies according to the tolerances of individual species for different sets of climatic conditions. This hypothesis predicts that more combinations of physiological parameters can survive under warm and wet than cold or dry conditions. Data are qualitatively consistent with this prediction, but are inconsistent with the prediction that species should fill climatically suitable areas. Finally, the 'speciation rate hypothesis' postulates that speciation rates should vary with climate, due either to faster evolutionary rates or stronger biotic interactions increasing the opportunity for evolutionary diversification in some regions. The biotic interactions mechanism also has the potential to amplify shallower, underlying gradients in richness. Tests of speciation rate hypotheses are few (to date), and their results are mixed.

AB Freshwater sponges (Spongillidae) were evaluated in a southern Lake Michigan harbor to determine whether preferences existed for attachment sites. Sponges were enumerated that were growing epifaunally on zebra mussel shells and directly on the associated iron revetment wall surrounding a portion of the harbor. Adult colonies of sponges were non-randomly distributed and found in close association with zebra mussel shells. The mechanism for this biotic interaction is unknown. However, this is another example of benthic restructuring of native fauna precipitated by the non-indigenous zebra mussel.

AB I surveyed treeholes in central Pennsylvania for 7 mo in 1995 to investigate relationships among insect communities and water and leaf litter resources. I used water volume, essential to growth of treehole larvae, as an indicator of habitat size. Leaf litter is the basal food resource in treehole communities, and litter volume is related to the amount of energy available. Insect species richness and larval mosquito (Ochlerotatus triseriatus) and ceratopogonid midge (Culicoides guttipennis) densities were higher in treeholes that maintained high water volumes than those with low volumes throughout the study. Treeholes with high litter volume, irrespective of water volume, had the highest densities of C. guttipennis, and higher total larval densities than those with lower litter volumes; however, litter volume did not affect insect species richness. Scirtid beetle larvae were common in all treeholes, although their densities were unaffected by both litter and water volume. Insect species richness was not related to litter volume, unlike some other studies of phytotelmata. However, my study supported earlier conclusions that both habitat size and resource availability influence structure of treehole communities and maintain species populations. The influence of each resource on particular species presence and density may be related to physical aspects of treeholes, biotic interactions, and natural history of individual species.

AB Understanding the mechanisms that result in the success of introduced species will contribute to predicting future invasions and managing invaded systems. We examined interactions between larvae of two predatory ladybird species recently introduced to North America, Coccinella septempunctata (CS) and Harmonia axyridis (HA), and two indigenous ladybirds, Coccinella transversoguttata (CT) and Hippodamia convergens (HC). By pairing young and old larvae in the laboratory at low and high levels of aphid availability, we assessed the degree of asymmetry in intraguild predation (IGP), the strength of competitive effects on growth and development of larvae escaping predation, and the nature of attack and escape behavior among the species. Interactions were generally asymmetric, with larvae of introduced species acting most frequently as intraguild predators and larvae of indigenous species serving most frequently as intraguild prey ( the two Coccinella spp., however, preyed on each other at similar rates). Because they were especially aggressive and because other larvae were least successful in escaping their attacks, larvae of HA had stronger negative effects on larvae of the two indigenous species than did larvae of CS. Such negative effects, expressed most strongly when aphid availability was low, were especially adverse for the smaller of the two indigenous species, HC. In general, older larvae interacted with each other more strongly than young larvae did, and older larvae had especially strong negative effects on young larvae when interactions occurred between age classes. Our results suggest that HA more than CS may represent a threat to indigenous ladybirds as an intraguild predator, and that IGP in turn may play a stronger role for HA than for C. septempunctata in promoting the successful invasion of North America.

AB The question whether species co-occurrence patterns are non-random has intrigued ecology for more than two decades. Recently Gotelli and McCabe used meta-analysis to show that natural assemblages indeed tend to have non-random species co-occurrence patterns and that these patterns are in line with the predictions of Diamond's assembly rule model. Here I show that neutral ecological drift models are able to generate patterns in line with Diamond's assembly rules and very similar to the empirical results in Gotelli and McCabe. Ecological drift shifted species co-occurrence patterns (measured by C-scores, checkerboard scores and species combination scores) of model species placed into a grid of the 25 cells (sites; metacommunity sizes 5 to 25 species with 100 individuals each) significantly from an initial random pattern towards a pattern predicted by the assembly rule model of Diamond. These findings imply that instead of asking whether natural communities are structured according to some assembly rules we should ask whether these non-random patterns are generated by species interactions or by stochastic drift processes.

AB This paper investigates the effect of a dynamic landscape on the persistence of many interacting species. We develop a multispecies community model with an evolving landscape in which the creation and destruction of habitat are dynamic and local in space. Species interactions are also local involving hierarchical competitive trade-offs. We show that dynamic landscapes can reverse the trend of increasing species richness with higher fragmentation observed in static landscapes. The increase in the species-area exponent from a homogeneous to a fragmented landscape does not occur when dynamics are turned on. Thus, temporal aspects of the processes that generate and destroy habitat appear dominant relative to spatial characteristics. We also demonstrate, however, that temporal and spatial aspects interact to influence the persistence time of individual species, and therefore, rank-abundance curves. Specifically, persistence in the model increases in habitats with faster local turnover because of the presence of dynamic corridors. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB When predators differentiate among prey species, they commonly select the most abundant species. Surprisingly, on coral reefs in Australia and the Bahamas, we found evidence to the contrary: using null models, we observed that generalist predators had a greater impact on less-abundant species, thereby reducing local species richness. Disproportionate effects on these rare species were evident during a narrow window of time between settlement and 1-2 days later, highlighting how interactions during or immediately following settlement may influence subsequent community structure. Differences in species richness between treatments that were established during this narrow window of time eventually disappeared from reefs in Australia but persisted on reefs in the Bahamas. Our results highlight an unexpected and largely unexplored ecological interaction whereby predators reduce prey diversity.

AB The intriguing impact of physical mixing processes on species interactions has always fascinated ecologists. Here, we exploit recent advances in plankton models to develop competition theory that predicts how changes in turbulent mixing affect competition for light between buoyant and sinking phytoplankton species. We compared the model predictions with a lake experiment, in which the turbulence structure of the entire lake was manipulated using artificial, mixing. Vertical eddy diffusivities were calculated from the measured temperature microstructure in the lake. Changes in turbulent mixing of the take caused a dramatic shift in phytoplankton species composition, consistent with the predictions of the competition model. The buoyant and potentially toxic cyanobacterium Microcystis dominated at low turbulent diffusivity, whereas sinking diatoms and green algae dominated at high turbulent diffusivity. These findings warn that changes in the turbulence structure of natural waters, for instance driven by climate change, may induce major shifts in the species composition of phytoplankton communities.

AB Metacommunity theories, which consider communities as interacting species assemblages connected by dispersal, differ in their assumptions about the importance of interspecific adaptations and environmental heterogeneity as controls of assemblage composition. I assess the relative importance of regional (dispersal) and local (abiotic and biotic environmental variation) processes in explaining the structure of a freshwater pond metacommunity. Results did not support the hypothesis that dispersal was limited by interpatch distance. Instead, community diversity, composition, and trophic structure were best explained by local environmental variation associated with pond permanence. Many taxa were restricted either to temporary or semipermanent ponds, an outcome that suggests species trade off adaptations to disturbance with those to biotic interactions (species-sorting model) and that refutes the neutral model of interspecific equivalence. However, evidence for high dispersal rates, low-fitness habitats, and high temporal environmental variability indicated that interpatch dispersal also may influence local dynamics through mass effects. These results suggest that integrating the species-sorting and mass-effect niche assembly frameworks will provide a necessary step in the successful application of metacommunity theory.

AB The fundamental niche can be viewed as the set of conditions and resources that allow a given organism to survive and reproduce in the absence of biotic interactions. Quantitative descriptions of the environmental variables with which organisms are associated are becoming common with the advent of geographic information systems (GIS). Although such descriptive approaches to the niche are useful for interpolating species distributions, they implicitly incorporate biotic interactions and therefore do not represent the fundamental niche. A mechanistic understanding of the fundamental niche, when combined with GIS data, can provide us with greater insight into the causes of distribution and abundance, a solid foundation for exploring the role of biotic interactions, and greater confidence in extrapolating to novel circumstances such as climate change and species introductions. We apply such a mechanistic approach to Study the climatic component of the fundamental niche of a nocturnal lizard, Heteronotia binoei, across an entire continent. We combine physiological measurements of this species (thermal requirements for egg development, thermal preferences and tolerances, metabolic and evaporative water loss rates), and high-resolution climatic data for the Australian continent (ail, temperature, cloud cover, wind speed, humidity, and radiation), with biophysical models to calculate the climatic component of the fundamental niche of this lizard and map it onto the Australian landscape at high resolution. We also use this approach to predict the effects of a mild global warming on the degree-days in the soil for egg development and the potential for aboveground activity of the study organism.

AB Carbon : nitrogen : phosphorus (C : N : P) stoichiometry can underlie physiological and life history characteristics that shape ecological interactions. Despite its potential importance, there is much to learn about the causes and consequences of stoichiometric variation in terrestrial consumers. Here we show that treehoppers (Publilia modesta) tended by ants (Formica obscuripes) contained lower N concentrations than treehoppers on plants from which ants were excluded. Ant presence also affected nutrient concentrations in host plants: on plants with ants, leaves contained uniformly low concentrations of N; on plants without ants, N concentrations were low only in the few leaves fed upon by treehoppers at the time of collection. We suggest treehopper feeding reduces leaf nutrient levels and ants positively affect treehopper abundance, producing a top-down effect on plant quality. Determining the causes of these stoichiometric changes should help elucidate factors guiding the dynamics of conditional mutualisms between ants and homopterans.

AB Ecological immunology attempts to elucidate the causes of the large variation in immunity and resistance observed in natural populations. Here we report on a novel experiment that investigated how the risks of parasitism and predation altered investment in immunity and condition in insects during larval development. The study organism is the damselfly Coenagrion puella, the parasite is a water mite and the predators are encaged Aeshna ryanea dragonflies. Our experiments show that females increase their investment in a cellular as well as a humoral component of the immune system in the presence of natural enemies. By contrast, males do not show such alteration. However, males show altered condition under the risks of parasitism and predation. Our results highlight the importance of species interactions for the plasticity of immune function.

AB Arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM) can ameliorate the impact of disturbance on agroecosystem sustainability. The objective of this study was to describe mycorrhizal colonization patterns in contrasting grazing situations (exclosure and continuous grazing) and topographical positions (upland and lowland) in the flooding pampa (Argentina). We determined the mycorrhizal colonization of the community as a whole and of Dallis grass (Paspalum dilatatum Poir.), a highly palatable, dominant species. We characterized colonization by the proportion of root length occupied by fungi and their different structures. At the community level, there was higher total colonization in the grazed area than in the exclosure. In contrast, Dallis grass showed higher total colonization and higher proportion of vesicles and arbuscules in the exclosure than in the grazed area. For both levels, colonization was higher in the lowland than in the upland position. Differences were observed only in winter and spring, not in summer. Our results show that 1) continuous grazing is associated with an increase of mycorrhizal colonization at the community level and 2) community-level patterns of mycorrhizal colonization cannot be inferred from dominant species. To our knowledge, this is the first characterization of AM abundance at the plant community level under contrasting long-term grazing conditions in a subhumid grassland.

AB We examined inter-specific interactions among goshawks (Accipiter gentilis), common buzzards (Buteo buteo) and honey buzzards (Pernis apivorus) in western Finland in 1983-1996. Because goshawks are among the largest birds of prey species in boreal forests they may take over the nest of smaller and less-competitive forest-dwelling raptors when searching for suitable places for breeding. Accordingly, more than half of newly established goshawk territories were found on the territories previously occupied by the common buzzard and the honey buzzard. Otherwise, territory sharing between these species was rare. Fledgling production of honey buzzards was not associated with the presence of goshawks, probably owing to the almost 2 months later onset of breeding. This probably decreases competitive interactions between these two species. An intensive interference competition, instead, seemed to be evident between common buzzards and goshawks, because the fledgling production of common buzzards was decreased by 20% as a result of failures during incubation and nestling period in the vicinity (<1 km) of occupied goshawk nests. Similarly, territory occupancy of common buzzards till the next breeding season was significantly reduced in the presence of goshawks. Relatively high proportions of occupied buzzard territories (17%) in the study area were shared by breeding goshawks on the same territory. This suggests that although their diets are dissimilar they inhabit similar habitats and might compete for the available prime nesting habitats within forest landscapes. In addition, goshawks benefit from taking over the complete nests of other raptors, imposing upon the original owners of the nest, because building a large stick nest is probably energetically costly. As a large raptor, the goshawk apparently has a competitive advantage over smaller ones, and may have an ever-increasing impact on smaller birds of prey, if there is a lack of sheltered forests inducing competition for the available nest sites.

AB Ecological character displacement occurs when sympatric species compete with one another, resulting in morphological divergence. Theoretically, character displacement can evolve from a number of ecological interactions, such as exploitation, interference, or predation, but most examples describe species competing exploitatively for limiting resources (typically food). Here I report a case of character displacement evolving from aggressive behavioral interference, found in a well-studied system of terrestrial salamanders of the genus Plethodon. Using geometric morphometrics, I found parallel shifts in head shape from allopatry to sympatry in both P. jordani and P. teyahalee, and found significantly greater morphological divergence in sympatry relative to allopatry. Both findings are consistent with ecological character displacement. I also show a significant association between morphology and aggressive behavior, demonstrating a direct link between interference competition and morphology. I present a modified set of the criteria for character displacement that are appropriate for discriminating character displacement via aggressive interference from other possible evolutionary mechanisms. For this example, empirical support satisfying five of the six criteria for character displacement is found. These results provide evidence that morphological variation can be generated by mechanisms other than resource exploitation, which has profound implications for interpreting patterns of biological diversity.

AB In ecological theory species interaction strengths are typically described by constants or functions that depend on the densities of the two interacting species. However, if species' traits (phenotypes) are plastic, then modifications in these traits (induced by the presence of another species) could affect interaction strengths of the focal species with a number of other species in the system. The magnitudes of such higher-order effects on interaction strengths have not been reported and are not straightforward to measure. We present a methodology to quantify changes in consumer-resource interaction coefficients (a metric of interaction strength) due to effects of predators on consumer (i.e., the prey of the predator) phenotype (e.g., nonlethal or trait-mediated effects). Application of this method to studies in diverse systems indicates that predators can strongly reduce consumer-resource interaction coefficients, often in the range of 20-80%. We use analytic and simulation models to show that effects on interaction coefficients of this magnitude can lead to trait-mediated effects that contribute more strongly than density-mediated effects to the net effects of predators on consumers and their resources, and even qualitatively change model predictions. Our results strengthen previous claims that trait-mediated effects strongly influence species interactions and suggest that recent calls to quantify interaction strengths must be broadened to include examination of the variation in interaction strengths due to their dependence on densities of other species (most notably predators) in food webs.

AB 1 Plant community development depends to a great extent on the availability of soil nutrients, but recent studies underline the role of symbiotic, herbivorous and pathogenic soil biota. We tested for interactions between these biotic and abiotic factors by studying the effects of additional nutrients and the removal of soil biota on the replacement of grassland plant species typical of different successional stages.
   2 Species representing each of the early, mid and target phases of secondary succession in a grassland community (four per phase) were grown in mid-successional grassland soil. The mixed plant communities were grown in sterilized and non-sterilized soil, at three nutrient supply levels. The distribution of shoot biomass over the different plant species, and the total root biomass, were determined, as well as the composition of nematode and microarthropod communities and soil decomposition rates.
   3 The effect of nutrient supply on plant community composition depended on soil sterilization. In sterilized soil, the plant community was initially dominated by grasses that increased in dominance even without fertilization. In non-sterilized soil, the plant community was more diverse and grass dominance decreased over time, except with high fertilization. Fertilization enhanced the productivity of the plant community in sterilized and, to a greater extent, in non-sterilized soil.
   4 The abundance of root-feeding nematodes was positively related to increased root biomass, pointing to a strong bottom-up control. Increased levels of nutrient supply were associated with reduced abundance of omnivorous nematodes, the cause of this reduction being less clear. Increased soil fertility altered the functional diversity of the soil nematode community, which might, in the longer term, also affect their feedback effects on the plant community.
   5 Increased nutrient supply reduced soil decomposition activity in the non-sterilized soil, but not in the sterilized soil.
   6 Our results imply that soil biota may reduce the effects of nutrient supply on plant dominance. Incorporating the effects of soil biota on plant species interactions into studies on succession, plant species diversity and restoration may therefore considerably increase our understanding of the observed plant community patterns.

AB Completion of the Panama Canal in 1914 breached the continental divide and set into motion a natural experiment of unprecedented magnitude by bringing previously isolated freshwater fish communities into contact. The construction of a freshwater corridor connecting evolutionarily isolated communities in Pacific and Caribbean watersheds dramatically increased the rate of dispersal, without directly affecting species interactions. Here, we report that a large fraction of species have been able to establish themselves on the other side of the continental divide, whereas no species have become extinct, leading to a local increase in species richness. Our results suggest that communities are not saturated and that competitive exclusion does not occur over the time-scale previously envisioned. Moreover, the results of this unintentional experiment demonstrate that community composition and species richness were regulated by the regional process of dispersal, rather than by local processes such as competition and predation.

AB Theoretical interest in the distributions of species abundances observed in ecological communities has focused recently on the results of models that assume all species are identical in their interactions with one another, and rely upon immigration and speciation to promote coexistence. Here we examine a one-trophic level system with generalized species interactions, including species-specific intraspecific and interspecific interaction strengths, and density-independent immigration from a regional species pool. Comparisons between results from numerical integrations and an approximate analytic calculation for random communities demonstrate good agreement, and both approaches yield abundance distributions of nearly arbitrary shape, including bimodality for intermediate immigration rates.

AB Geographical differentiation of populations can be interpreted as a result of adaptive processes in response to environmental gradients and biotic interactions. Such adaptations are particularly interesting in invasive alien species which have been present in an area for a relatively short time. There are few observations of latitudinal trends in alien plants, and no account exists for Impatiens glandulifera, a problematic annual weed in most countries of central and north-western Europe. Here we describe variation in growth and phenology in 26 populations of this species from nine European regions in a common garden in Denmark. Above-ground biomass (an estimate of fecundity), height and basal diameter were lower in the northern populations which were first to produce flowers. Some differences were also observed in biomass allocation to leaves, flowers and fruits, albeit without a latitudinal pattern. The latitudinal trends in growth and survival disappeared in a field experiment, probably due to suboptimal site conditions. Most variation in plant traits was explained by differences among regions with some minor effects of populations within regions. Besides latitude, no other geographical, climatic or population trait correlated with the observed differences in growth and phenology. Differences in latitude may mainly represent variation in length of the growing season. The causes and potential consequences of such latitudinal trends for population dynamics and dispersal of alien plants are discussed.

AB The temperate deciduous forest of the northeastern United States is believed to be undergoing a shift from domination by mixed oak (Quercus sp.) to red maple (Acer rubrum); a shift termed "The Red Maple Paradox." This shift in the composition of the forest has the potential to affect ecosystems within the forest that use leaf litter as an energy source. To assess the impact of the red maple paradox on detrital food webs, we conducted a mesocosm experiment investigating the influence of red maple litter on the food web of temporary woodland ponds. Amphibian biomass and survival were significantly lower in experimental ponds that contained only maple litter. The negative effects of maple litter were most pronounced in larval wood frogs (Rana sylvatica). We hypothesize that this effect resulted from a temporary shift from a grazing-based food web in oak mesocosms to a microbial-based food web in maple mesocosms, as oak mesocosms initially had higher levels of phytoplankton biomass and lower levels of bacterial production than maple mesocosms. This bottom-up effect of maple litter on wood frogs then appeared to affect other amphibians and zooplankton through a complex series of interactions. These data suggest that litter composition impacted the performance of most trophic groups by altering the processing of energy in this system, thereby destabilizing species interactions throughout the food web. Therefore, "subtle" compositional shifts in the forest have the potential to influence communities that rely upon leaf litter inputs as a primary source of energy.

AB Competition among plants in extreme environments such as the High Arctic has often been described as unimportant, or even nonexistent; environmental factors are thought to overrule any negative plant-plant interactions. However, few studies have actually addressed this question experimentally in the Arctic, and those that did found only little evidence for competition. Such species interactions will presumably become more important in the future, as Global Climate Change takes effect on terrestrial ecosystems. We investigated plant-plant interactions in the High Arctic, following the growth of Luzula confusa and Salix polaris in pure and mixed stands, and under elevated-temperature treatment over 2 years. To understand the mechanisms of competition, a parallel experiment was undertaken in phytotrons, manipulating competition, temperature and nutrient availability. Our findings indicate that competition is acting in the natural vegetation, and that climatic warming will alter the balance of interactions in favour of the dwarf shrub S. polaris. The phytotron experiment suggested that the mechanism is a higher responsiveness of Salix to nutrient availability, which increased under warming in the field. While Luzula showed a positive response to higher temperature in the lab, its performance in mixed stands in the field was actually reduced by warming, indicating a competitive repression of growth by Salix. The growth of Salix was also reduced by the presence of Luzula, but it was still able to profit from warming. Our findings suggest that climatic warming will result in greater shrub dominance of High Arctic tundra, but we also conjecture that grazing could reverse the situation to a graminoid-dominated tundra. These two divergent scenarios would have different implications for ecosystem feedbacks to climatic change.

AB Aim We analyse the proximate causes of the large variation in flowering periodicity among four tropical dry forests (TDF) and ask whether climatic periodicity or biotic interactions are the ultimate causes of flowering periodicity.
   Location The four TDFs in Guanacaste (Costa Rica), Yucatan, Jalisco and Sonora (Mexico) are characterized by a 5-7 month long dry season and are located along a gradient of increasing latitude (10-30degreesN).
   Methods To dissect the differences in flowering periodicity observed at the community level, individual tree species were assigned to 'flowering types', i.e. groups of species with characteristic flowering periods determined by similar combinations of environmental flowering cues and vegetative phenology.
   Results Large variation in the fraction of species and flowering types blooming during the dry and wet season, respectively, indicates large differences in the severity of seasonal drought among the four forests. In the dry upland forests of Jalisco, flowering of leafless trees remains suppressed during severe seasonal drought and is triggered by the first rains of the wet season. In the other forests, leaf shedding, exceptional rainfall or increasing daylength cause flowering of many deciduous species at various times during the dry season, well before the summer rains. The fraction of deciduous species leafing out during the summer rains and flowering when leafless during the dry season is largest in the Sonoran TDF.
   Main conclusions In many wide-ranging species the phenotypic plasticity of flowering periodicity is large. The distinct temporal separation of spring flowering on leafless shoots and subsequent summer flushing represents a unique adaptation of tree development to climates with a relatively short rainy season and a long dry season. Seasonal variation in rainfall and soil water availability apparently constitutes not only the proximate, but also the ultimate cause of flowering periodicity, which is unlikely to have evolved in response to biotic adaptive pressures.

AB 1. In simple microcosm systems, the form of interspecific abundance-occupancy relationships has been found to be dependent on biotic interactions. However, in more complex systems such effects may be obscured by those of habitat heterogeneity. Here we test this proposal using laboratory microcosms of protists and bacteria.
   2. The independent effects of species interactions and heterogeneity were tested by comparison of the abundance-occupancy relationship formed in multiple habitat patch systems containing all species together, with that relationship formed by combining data from equivalent systems containing each protist species alone and between homogeneous and heterogeneous environments.
   3. There was more residual variation about positive interspecific abundance-occupancy relationships formed in heterogeneous environments in interacting and non-interacting communities as the majority of species were more restricted in the number of patches they could occupy compared to homogeneous landscapes.
   4. Abundance-occupancy relationships in interacting communities were better defined than those in non-interacting communities. The inclusion of interspecific interactions caused a reduction in the abundance and occupancy of the majority of species and changed the position of species within the relationship.
   5. Our results show that biotic interactions influence the abundance-occupancy relationships even with imposed environmental heterogeneity. However, in heterogeneous environments, for some species these processes occurred in fewer patches, causing increased residual variation about positive interspecific abundance-occupancy relationships compared to homogeneous environments.

AB The relative abundances of Chenopodiaceae shrubs are different from the seed composition in the original seed mix when sown on mine waste material in semiarid regions of Western Australia. Experiments were therefore undertaken to determine what species interactions are responsible for shifts in relative abundance after seeding. The growth parameters of five members of the Chenopodiaceae were used to determine intra- and interspecific density-dependent interactions. Dominant and subordinant species were paired and grown in pots at differing densities. The growth parameters measured were height, root, and shoot biomass. Of the five species chosen for this study, Maireana georgei (golden bluebush) and Enchylaena tomentosa (ruby saltbush) do not establish well on mine site areas. These were sensitive to density in monoculture, as well as in the presence of both Atriplex bunburyana (silver saltbush) and Atriplex codonocarpa (flat-topped saltbush). Although Maireana brevifolia (small leaf bluebush) does establish successfully on mine sites when sown, it showed the same negative reaction when grown in monoculture and in a two-species mixture. Atriplex bunburyana and A. codonocarpa, in contrast, are dominant species and reacted differently when grown with increasing numbers of the target species (M. georgei, M. brevifolia, and E. tomentosa). Atriplex bunburyana did not exhibit any decreases in growth when grown in competition with up to four plants of the target species. However, A. codonocarpa did react adversely to the presence of the target species. It is thought that the resulting plant community organization reflects the original seed mixture, which is usually sown at a high density. Yet, this study has shown that the differing intra- and interspecific density responses of these chenopod species provide an indication of the resulting community organization. To maximize diversity and to prevent dominance by highly competitive species, such as A. bunburyana, it is important to take density-dependent effects into account during the restoration planning stage.

AB We examine the impact of temporal variation on adaptive evolution in "sink" environments, where a species encounters conditions outside its niche. Sink populations persist because of recurrent immigration from sources. Prior studies have highlighted the importance of demographic constraints on adaptive evolution in sinks and revealed that adaptation is less likely in harsher sinks. We examine two complementary models of population and evolutionary dynamics in sinks: a continuous-state quantitative-genetics model and an individual-based model. In the former, genetic variance is fixed; in the latter, genetic variance varies because of mutation, drift, and sampling. In both models, a population in a constant harsh sink environment can exist in alternative states: local maladaptation ( phenotype comparable to immigrants from the source) or adaptation ( phenotype near the local optimum). Temporal variation permits transitions between these states. We show that moderate amounts of temporal variation can facilitate adaptive evolution in sinks, permitting niche evolution, particularly for slow or autocorrelated variation. Such patterns of temporal variation may particularly pertain to sinks caused by biotic interactions ( e. g., predation). Our results are relevant to the evolutionary dynamics of species' ranges, the fate of exotic invasive species, and the evolutionary emergence of infectious diseases into novel hosts.

AB Understanding the unique contributions of ecology and history to the distribution of species within communities requires an integrative approach. The Eastern Continental Divide in southwestern Virginia separates river drainages that differ in species composition: the more aquatic, predatory Desmognathus quadramaculatus is present only in the New River drainage ( which drains to the Gulf of Mexico), while Desmognathus monticola is present in both the New River drainage and the James River drainage ( which drains to the Atlantic Ocean). We investigated natural distributions, behavioral variation in experimental mesocosms, population genetic, and phylogenetic implications of community structure. The presence of D. quadramaculatus increased the terrestriality of D. monticola in natural and experimental situations but to different degrees in allopatric and sympatric populations. Our ecological data suggest that the degree of terrestriality in D. monticola is a result of a balance between the optimal aquatic habitat and risks of predation. Our genetic analyses suggest that D. monticola has experienced a recent range expansion and has only a recent history of association with D. quadramaculatus in Virginia. This is surprising given the strong behavioral variation that exists in populations experiencing unique community compositions over a scale of meters. This study demonstrates the need to combine both ecology and genetics toward an understanding of the factors affecting species distributions, behavioral variation between populations, and patterns of genetic variation across a landscape.

AB Changes in species composition of communities seem to proceed gradually at first sight, but remarkably rapid shifts are known to occur. Although disrupting disturbances seem an obvious explanation for such shifts, evidence for large disturbances is not always apparent. Here we show that complex communities tend to move through occasional catastrophic shifts in response to gradual environmental change or evolution. This tendency is caused by multiple attractors that may exist in such systems. We show that alternative attractors arise robustly in randomly generated multispecies models, especially if competition is symmetrical and if interspecific competition is allowed to exceed intraspecific competition. Inclusion of predators as a second trophic level did not alter the results greatly, although it reduced the probability of alternative attractors somewhat. These results suggest that alternative attractors may commonly arise from interactions between large numbers of species. Consequently, the response of complex communities to environmental change is expected to be characterized by hysteresis and sudden shifts. Some unexplained regime shifts observed in ecosystems could be related to alternative attractors arising from complex species interactions. Additionally, our results support the idea that ancient mass extinctions may partly be due to an intrinsic loss of stability of species configurations.

AB Species conservation may be complicated in symbiotic interactions. Sub-lethal impacts of human activities on one species may be lethal to other species on which they depend. We investigated the impact of two aspects of eutrophication - changes in phytoplankton and oxygen levels - on the interaction between a freshwater fish that is endangered in several countries, the European bitterling, Rhodeus sericeus, and the unionid mussel hosts that they require for spawning. Reduced concentrations of algae and oxygen each led to a greater proportion of bitterling embryos being ejected prematurely from the mussel hosts. Reduced algal concentrations also led to reductions in mussel ventilation rates and to mussels spending less time with their valves open. Bitterling mortality may have been due to three causes: direct effects of environmental conditions on embryonic survival, active expulsion by mussels when stressed and through responses by mussels that created internal conditions that bitterling embryos could not survive. Our study shows that the sub-lethal effects of pollution on one species can have lethal effects on another species with which it interacts. Such interactions need to be considered in conservation programmes.

AB The literature on biological invasions has principally focused on understanding the ecological controls and consequences of invasions. Invading populations, however, often experience rapid evolutionary changes associated with or soon after their introduction. Ecological and evolutionary processes can, therefore, potentially interact over relatively short timescales.
   A number of recent studies have begun to document these interactions and their effect on short-term invasion dynamics: (1) The degree to which founder effects, drift, and inbreeding alter the genetic composition of introduced populations is mediated by migration and dispersal patterns, the population dynamics of founding populations, and life history. The genetic changes associated with founding can themselves feed back on population dynamics and life history. (2) Patterns of human-mediated dispersal and landscape change can influence the frequency and pattern of hybridization, which in turn can alter invasion dynamics. These altered invasion dynamics can influence the frequency and pattern of subsequent hybridization and introgression. (3) Strong selection can rapidly generate ecotypic specialization. Dispersal patterns, founder effects, genetic system, and life history influence the rate of local adaptation, its persistence, and its distribution in a landscape. (4) Introduced populations are subject to selection on life history traits and can serve as selective pressure on the life history traits of native populations. Life history evolution in both natives and aliens can influence ecological interactions and population dynamics, which in turn can influence the evolution of life history.
   Too few studies have investigated these interactions to definitively assess their overall generality or to determine how the.-relative interaction strength of ecology and evolution varies across taxa or ecosystems. However, the studies that do exist report interactions from a wide breadth of taxa and from all stages in the invasion process. This suggests that ecological-evolutionary interactions may have a more pervasive influence on contemporary invasion dynamics than previously appreciated, and that at least in some situations an explicit understanding of the contemporary co-influence of ecology and evolution can produce more effective and predictive control strategies.

AB Phenotypically plastic defenses are strategies to reduce predation risk in variable environments. Predator-induced formations of protective devices in cladocerans are prominent examples of phenotypically plastic defenses. To understand the adaptive value of a defense, it is better to investigate its effects in a multipredator context, instead of merely concentrating on a two-species interaction. Small cladocerans such as Daphnia cucullata are prey items for many aquatic invertebrate predators and thus comprise a useful model system to investigate defenses and their effects. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the helmets of Daphnia cucullata are inducible with chemical cues from different kinds of predators and that they act as a generalized defense offering protection against several predators, each using a different hunting strategy.
   Results from our induction experiment show that chemical cues released from Chaoborus flavicans, Leptodora kindtii, and Cyclops sp. induce significantly longer helmets and tail spines and thus act as proximate factors for cyclomorphosis in Daphnia cucullata. Our predation experiments revealed that the induced morphological changes offered protection against each of the predators tested. Interestingly, the protective mechanisms and the prey size classes which were protected differed between predator systems.
   Our results suggest that phenotypic plasticity in Daphnia cucullata evolved as a "diffuse" coevolution against different invertebrate predators which selectively feed on small prey items. The additive benefits may increase the adaptive value and thus facilitate the evolution and persistence of this generalized defense.

AB Predicting the effects of species extinction is challenging because of ecosystem complexity. Using novel long-term experimental deletions of two mussel species, I found that a multi-species Markov chain model, which was parameterized under non-experimental conditions, accurately predicted the effects of local extinction in an intertidal community. Systematically deleting species from the model predicted declining ecosystem biomass with reduced biodiversity, but relatively constant ecosystem resilience following disturbance. The effects of reduced biodiversity on these variables ranged widely, illustrating the need for species-specific predictions of extinction effects. The results show that Markov chain models can be useful tools for predicting consequences of local species extinction without extensive experimentation.

AB 1 Species interactions will probably be important in determining plant community structure as availability of soil nutrients changes due to climate warming or anthropogenic N deposition. We removed dominant species, combinations of species, and entire plant functional types, in fertilized and unfertilized plots in tussock tundra.
   2 After 2 years, graminoids responded more strongly to fertilizer than other growth forms, and the responses of graminoids and deciduous shrubs to fertilizer were greater under neighbour removal than in the intact community. Deciduous shrubs, evergreen shrubs and graminoids increased their biomass with fertilization, whereas non-vascular plants decreased.
   3 Dominant species from each growth form usually responded strongly to fertilization, but half of all subdominant species responded weakly or not at all. Few species responded to neighbour removal.
   4 Soil nutrient availability, however, was elevated significantly by both fertilization and neighbour removal. Neighbour removal increased nutrient availability in fertilized plots by up to two orders of magnitude, and availability of NH(4)(+) and NO(3)(-) in some unfertilized removal treatments was greater than in the fertilized intact community.
   5 The failure of many plant species to respond with enhanced growth to soil nutrients made available by neighbour removal, despite their response to fertilization, could be due to (i) tundra plants having such rigid niche complementarity that they are unable to utilize these additional resources, or (ii) insufficient time having elapsed for the remaining species to respond, because nutrients derived from neighbour removal probably became available later than nutrients added as fertilizer.
   6 There may be a high potential for loss of available nutrients from the tundra ecosystem when species composition changes, if the remaining plants cannot adjust to use nutrients made available by the loss of their neighbours.

AB Weather can have important consequences for the structure and function of ecological communities by substantially altering the nature and strength of species interactions. We examined the role of intra- and inter-annual weather variability on species interactions in a seasonal old-field community consisting of spider predators, grasshopper herbivores, and grass and herb plants. We experimentally varied the number of trophic levels for 2 consecutive years and tested for inter-annual variation in trophic abundances. Grasshopper emergence varied between years to the extent that the second growing season was 20% shorter than the first one. However, the damage grasshoppers inflicted on plants was greater in the second, shorter growing season. This inter-annual variation in plant abundance could be explained using the foraging-predation risk trade-off displayed by grasshoppers combined with their survival trajectory. Decreased grasshopper survival not only reduced the damage inflicted on plants, it weakened the strength of indirect effects of spiders on grass and herb plants. The most influential abiotic factor affecting grasshopper survival was precipitation. We found a negative association between grasshopper survival and the total yearly precipitation. A finer scale analysis, however, showed that different precipitation modalities, namely, number of rainy days and average precipitation per day, had opposing effects on grasshopper survival, which were inconsistent between years. Furthermore, our results suggest that small changes in these factors should result in changes of up to several orders of magnitude in the mortality rate of grasshoppers. We thus conclude that in this system the foraging-predation risk trade-off displayed by grasshoppers combined with their survival trajectory and relevant weather variability should be incorporated in analytical theory, whose goal is to predict community dynamics.

AB Despite ecologists increasingly recognizing pathogens as playing significant roles in community dynamics, few experimental studies have quantified patterns of disease impacts on natural systems. Amphibians are experiencing population declines, and a fungal pathogen (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis; Chytridiomycota) is a suspected causal agent in many declines. We studied the effects of a pathogenic fungus on community interactions between the gray treefrog, Hyla chrysoscelis, and eastern newts, Notophthalmus viridescens. Recent studies have characterized chytridiomycosis as an emerging infectious disease, whose suspected rapid range expansion and widespread occurrence pose a significant risk for amphibian populations worldwide. We reared larvae in outdoor polyethylene experimental tanks and tested the effects of initial larval density, predator presence, and fungal exposure on Hyla recruitment and predator-prey interactions between Hyla and Notophthalmus. Newts reduced treefrog survival, and high intraspecific density decreased metamorphic body mass independent of B. dendrobatidis. The presence of fungi reduced treefrog body mass at metamorphosis by 34%, but had no significant main effect on survival or larval period length. B. dendrobatidis differentially affected larval development in the presence of predators; Hyla developed slower when reared with the pathogen, but only when newts were present. This significant predator-by-pathogen interaction suggests that the impact of chytridiomycosis on larval amphibians may be exacerbated in complex communities. Our data suggest that B. dendrobatidis effects on host life history may be complex and indirect. Direct measurements of the community-level effects of pathogens offer an important opportunity to understand a significant threat to global biodiversity-declining amphibian populations.

AB Compensatory population dynamics among species stabilise aggregate community variables. Inter-specific competition is thought to be stabilising as it promotes asynchrony among populations. However, we know little about other inter-specific interactions, such as facilitation and granivory. Such interactions are also likely to influence population synchrony and community stability, especially in harsh environments where they are thought to have relatively strong effects in plant communities. We use a manipulative experiment to test the effects of granivores (harvester ants) and nurse plants (sdwarf shrubs) on annual plant community dynamics in the Negev desert, Israel. We present evidence for weak and inconsistent effects of harvester ants on plant abundance and on population and community stability. By contrast, we show that annual communities under shrubs were more species rich, had higher plant density and were temporally less variable than communities in the inter-shrub matrix. Species richness and plant abundance were also more resistant to drought in the shrub under-storey compared with the inter-shrub matrix, although population dynamics in both patch types were synchronised. Hence, we show that interspecific interactions other than competition affect community stability, and that hypothesised mechanisms linking compensatory dynamics and community stability may not operate to the same extent in arid plant communities.Compensatory population dynamics among species stabilise aggregate community variables.

AB We examine Robert MacArthur's hypothesis that niche breadth is positively associated with latitude ( the latitude - niche breadth hypothesis). This idea has been influential and long standing, yet no studies have evaluated its generality or the validity of its assumptions. We review the theoretical arguments suggesting a positive relationship between niche breadth and latitude. We also use available evidence to evaluate the assumptions and predictions of MacArthur's latitude - niche breadth hypothesis. We find that neither the assumptions nor the predictions of the hypothesis are supported by data. We propose an alternative hypothesis linking latitude with niche breadth. Unlike previous ideas, our conceptual framework does not require equilibrial assumptions and is based on recently uncovered patterns of species interactions.

AB Managing fish stocks in terms of a portfolio of economic assets is likely to significantly increase benefits for society relative to single-species approaches. A portfolio framework systematically combines fish stocks that are joined by ecology (e.g., predation, competition) and unspecialized fishing technologies (e.g., mixed-species trawls) into a portfolio which balances expected aggregate returns against the risks associated with stock-attribute and other uncertainties. To be productive, however, this framework must be combined with property rights institutions that clearly state management,objectives, create long-run time-horizons among harvesters, internalize spillovers caused by ecological and technological jointness, and reduce uncertainty through research and adaptive management. Although the cost of reducing scientific uncertainty about ecological interactions may limit the portfolio approach to intensive management of relatively few species, its scope can be broadened to integrate tradeoffs among more types of marine resources, such as nature preserves and oil and gas deposits.

AB Spatial structures may not only result from ecological interactions, they may also play an essential functional role in organizing the interactions. Modeling spatial patterns at multiple spatial and temporal scales is thus a crucial step to understand the functioning of ecological communities. PCNM (principal coordinates of neighbor matrices) analysis achieves a spectral decomposition of the spatial relationships among the sampling sites, creating variables that correspond to all the spatial scales that can be perceived in a given data set. The analysis then finds the scales to which a data table of interest responds. The significant PCNM variables can be directly interpreted in terms of spatial scales, or included in a procedure of variation decomposition with respect to spatial and environmental components. This paper presents four applications of PCNM analysis to ecological data representing combinations of: transect or surface data, regular or irregular sampling schemes, univariate or multivariate data. The data sets include Amazonian ferns, tropical marine zooplankton, chlorophyll in a marine lagoon, and oribatid mites in a peat bog. In each case, new ecological knowledge was obtained through PCNM analysis.

AB One of the most commonly predicted effects of global ocean warming on marine communities is a poleward shift in the distributional boundaries of species with an associated replacement of cold-water species by warm-water species. However, these types of predictions are imprecise and based largely on broad correlations in uncontrolled studies that examine changes in the distribution or abundances of species in relation to seawater temperature. Our study used an 18-year sampling program in intertidal and subtidal habitats and before-after, control-impact analyses. We show that a 3.5degreesC rise in seawater temperature, induced by the thermal outfall of a power-generating station, over 10 years along 2 km of rocky coastline in California resulted in significant community-wide changes in 150 species of algae and invertebrates relative to adjacent control areas experiencing natural temperatures. Contrary to predictions based on current biogeographic models, there was no trend toward warmer-water species with southern geographic affinities replacing colder-water species with northern affinities. Instead, the communities were greatly altered in apparently cascading responses to changes in abundance of several key taxa, particularly habitat-forming subtidal kelps and intertidal foliose red algae. Many temperature-sensitive algae decreased greatly in abundance, whereas many invertebrate grazers increased. The responses of these benthic communities to ocean warming were-mostly unpredicted and strongly, coupled to direct effects of temperature on key taxa and indirect effects operating through ecological interactions.

AB Intraguild predation (IGP), defined as killing and eating among potential competitors, seems to be a ubiquitous interaction, differing from competition or predation. In the present study we assess the frequency of IGP among 763 potential intraguild prey and 599 potential intraguild predators. Our results indicate that IGP is common in nature, reaching frequencies between 58.4 and 86.7%. A null model suggests that IGP in different groups of predators and prey (i.e. carnivores, omnivores, herbivores, detritivores, or top and intermediate species) have different deviations from a chance expectation, indicating these attributes of species biology as main determinants of IGP persistence. We suggest that IGP satisfies two basic requirements to be considered as important to the trophic structuring of communities. First, its occurrence is not random, rather it is associated with well-defined attributes of species biology, and secondly, it is a widespread interaction.

AB In many studies, interspecific territorial behaviours among co-existing species have been used to infer the presence and the intensity of underlying ecological interactions between species, mainly resource competition. However, the theoretical background of this inference is insufficient. Hence. we constructed a simple theoretical model of interspecific territoriality assuming that interspecific territorial defence is the optimal behaviour. We discuss the factors promoting interspecific territoriality and the relationship between interspecific territoriality and ecological interactions. The model predicts that: (1) a territory holder preferentially excludes intruders of species with high 'exclusion efficiency's (2) the decision by the territory holder to exclude a certain species or not does not depend on the probability of finding intruders of the species or on the number of intrusions by the species, and (3) interspecific territoriality does not always reflect the intensity of ecological interactions between species. These results indicate that the observation of interspecific territoriality does not necessarily indicate the intensity of ecological interactions. In addition, if territory holders defend their territories as predicted by the present optimal model, the co-existence of competing species is promoted.

AB Yucca moths are most well known for their obligate pollination mutualism with yuccas, where pollinator moths provide yuccas with pollen and, in exchange, the moth larvae feed on a subset of the developing yucca seeds. The pollinators, however, comprise only two of the three genera of yucca moths. Members of the third genus, Prodoxus, are the "bogus yucca moths" and are sister to the pollinator moths. Adult Prodoxus lack the specialized mouthparts used for pollination and the larvae feed on plant tissues other than seeds. Prodoxus larvae feed within the same plants as pollinator larvae and have the potential to influence yucca reproductive success directly by drawing resources away from flowers and fruit, or indirectly by modifying the costs of the mutualism with pollinators. We examined the interaction between the scape-feeding bogus yucca moth, Prodoxus decipiens, and one of its yucca hosts, Yucca filamentosa, by comparing female reproductive success of plants with and without moth larvae. We determined reproductive success by measuring a set of common reproductive traits such as flowering characteristics, seed set, and seed germination. In addition, we also quantified the percent total nitrogen in the seeds to determine whether the presence of larvae could potentially reduce seed quality. Flowering charactenstics, seed set, and seed germination were not significantly different between plants with and without bogus yucca moth larvae. In contrast, the percent total nitrogen content of seeds was significantly lower in plants with R decipiens larvae, and nitrogen content was negatively correlated with the number of larvae feeding within the inflorescence scape. Surveys of percent total nitrogen at three time periods during the flowering and fruiting of Y filamentosa also showed that larval feeding decreased the amount of nitrogen in fruit tissue. Taken together, the results suggest that although R decipiens influences nitrogen distribution in Y filamentosa, this physiological effect does not appear to impact the female components of reproductive success.

AB A number of studies at large scales have pointed out that ablotic factors and recolonization dynamics appear to be more important than biotic interactions in structuring stream-fish assemblages. In contrast, experimental and field studies at small scales show the importance of competition among stream fishes. However, given the highly variable nature of stream systems over time, competition may not be intense enough to generate large-scale complementary distributions via competitive exclusion. Complementary distribution is a recurrent pattern observed in fish communities across stream gradients, though it is not clear which instances of this pattern are due to competitive interactions and which to individual species' requirements. In this study, I introduce a series of null models developed to provide a more robust evaluation of species associations by facilitating the distinction between different processes that may shape species distributions and community assembly. These null models were applied to test whether conspicuous patterns in species co-occurrences are more consistent with their differences in habitat use, morphological features and/or phylogenetic constraints, or with species interactions in fish communities in the streams of a watershed in eastern Brazil. I concluded that patterns in species co-occurrences within the studied system are driven by common species-habitat relationships and species interactions may not play a significant role in structuring these communities. I suggest that large-scale studies, where adequate designs and robust analytical tools are applied, can contribute substantially to understanding the importance of different types of processes in structuring stream-fish communities.

AB Individual variation in the diet of consumers is common in many ecological systems and has important implications for the study of population dynamics, animal behavior, and evolutionary or ecological interactions. Ecologists frequently quantify the niche of a population by intensive analyses of gut contents and feeding behaviors of consumers. Inter-individual differences in delta(13)C signature can indicate long term differences in feeding behavior, often unattainable by a single snapshot analysis of gut contents. If a consumer's food sources have delta(13)C signatures, then the intrapopulation variation in delta(13)C may be useful for quantifying diet variation and detecting isotopic evidence of individual specialization. However, intrapopulation variation in delta(13)C can underestimate or overestimate dietary variation, and therefore is not directly equivalent to a dietary based niche. In this paper we show that intrapopulation variability of delta(13)C in consumers critically depends on the isotopic range and distribution of food sources. Our analyses fundamentally challenge how we interpret the intrapopulation isotopic variance of delta(13)C, and how we evaluate isotopic evidence of individual specialization.

AB Closely related species that occur together in communities and experience similar environmental conditions are likely to share phenotypic traits because of the process of environmental filtering. At the same time, species that are too similar are unlikely to co-occur because of competitive exclusion. In an effort to explain the coexistence of 17 oak species within forest communities in North Central Florida, we examined correlations between the phylogenetic relatedness of oak species, their degree of co-occurrence within communities and niche overlap across environmental gradients, and their similarity in ecophysiological and life-history traits. We show that the oaks are phylogenetically overdispersed because co-occurring species are more distantly related than expected by chance, and oaks within the same clade show less niche overlap than expected. Hence, communities are more likely to include members of both the red oak and the oak clades than only members of one clade. white + live This pattern of phylogenetic overdispersion arises because traits important for habitat specialization show evolutionary convergence. We hypothesize further that certain conserved traits permit coexistence of distantly related congeners. These results provide an explanation for how oak diversity is maintained at the community level in North Central Florida.

AB Alternative explanations for disease and other population cycles typically include extrinsic environmental drivers, such as climate variability, and intrinsic nonlinear dynamics resulting from feedbacks within the system, such as species interactions and density dependence. Because these different factors can interact in nonlinear systems and can give rise to oscillations whose frequencies differ from those of extrinsic drivers, it is difficult to identify their respective contributions from temporal population patterns. In the case of disease, immunity is an important intrinsic factor. However, for many diseases, such as cholera, for which immunity is temporary, the duration and decay pattern of immunity is not well known. We present a nonlinear time series model with two related objectives: the reconstruction of immunity patterns from data on cases and population sizes and the identification of the respective roles of extrinsic and intrinsic factors in the dynamics. Extrinsic factors here include both seasonality and long-term changes or interannual variability in forcing. Results with simulated data show that this semiparametric method successfully recovers the decay of immunity and identifies the origin of interannual variability. An application to historical cholera data indicates that temporary immunity can be long-lasting and decays in approximately 9 yr. Extrinsic forcing of transmissibility is identified to have a strong seasonal component along with a long-term decrease. Furthermore, noise appears to sustain the multiple frequencies in the long-term dynamics. Similar semiparametric models should apply to population data other than for disease.

AB Ecologists have long sought to understand why some species are rare and others common. For the most part, inconsistent relationships between local rarity and underlying mechanisms have emerged. One possibility for this inconsistency is that locally rare species may not always be rare. However, it is largely unknown whether most locally rare species in a community possess the capacity to become abundant elsewhere in their geographical range. Here, we identified 57 locally rare plant species of open forest in south-eastern Australia. We found that most of these species (91%) occurred in higher abundance at other sites within their geographical range (somewhere-abundant species), while the remaining small percentage of locally rare species were consistently rare (everywhere-sparse species). Somewhere-abundant species had significantly smaller seeds on average than everywhere-sparse species in cross-species regression analysis. This pattern was not maintained when the influence of other life-history attributes was controlled for, or when phylogenetic relatedness among species was considered explicitly in phylogenetic regression analysis. In both cross-species and phylogenetic regressions, somewhere-abundant and everywhere-sparse species did not differ significantly with respect to growth form, height, regeneration-after-fire strategy, or dispersal. Our findings provide further evidence for the notion that theories to account for local rarity which are couched in terms of within-community interactions alone are incomplete for the majority of species, because they need to account for different outcomes in different places.

AB We studied nectar characteristics in 12 species of Neotropical hummingbird-pollinated plants: Aphelandra golfodulcensis, A. sinclairiana, A. storkii, Justicia aurea (Acanthaceae); Heliconia irrasa, H. latispatha, H. mathiasii (Heliconiaceae); Pavonia dasypetala (Malvaceae); Isertia haenkeana, Palicourea guianense, Pentagonia macrophylla (Rubiaceae); and Renealmia cernua (Zingiberaceae). The diurnal patterns in sugar content and cumulative volume of nectar were documented in flowers that were protected from flower visitors. Sugar content in these species (mean of all flowers sampled per species ranged from 16 to 28%) was comparable to those reported for other hummingbird-pollinated species. Mean nectar volume per flower spanned an order of magnitude (i.e., 8.8 [Palicourea]-72.7 mul [H. latispatha]), indicating that hummingbirds visited flowers with a wide range of reward. We observed low intraspecific variation in sugar content but high variation in nectar volume. Among species, 10-50 percent of the variation in nectar volume was explained by time of day. For a subset of four species (A. sinclairiana, Isertia, Palicourea, and Pentagonia), we studied variation among individuals in nectar volume. With time of day controlled, individual explained as much as 70 percent of the variation in nectar volume (A. sinclairiana) and as little as 20 percent (Pentagonia). We suggest that nectar volume likely has a genetic component in these species, but also that variation may itself be a trait, especially in Palicourea and Pentagonia. In three of the four species for which we had data from individuals, mean nectar volume and standard deviation were not correlated, suggesting that these traits may vary independently (Pentagonia was the exception with mean and standard deviation positively correlated). For two species (Isertia and Palicourea), we found evidence of seasonal variation in nectar production, with more nectar per flower produced early in the flowering season than later.

AB We documented the diurnal pattern of nectar volumes in flowers of seven Neotropical hummingbird-pollinated plant species that were open to flower visitors and compared these standing crop data to nectar volumes in flowers protected from visitors. Standing crop of nectar bore little relationship to nectar in bagged flowers either in terms of volume or temporal pattern of availability. There was almost no nectar in open flowers except in those collected at dawn and those of Aphelandra sinclairiana; these were apparently too abundant to be depleted by visitors. Nectar volumes in open flowers were even more variable than in bagged flowers. We argue that understanding the evolution of plant-pollinator interactions requires understanding the relationship between nectar production and standing crop, as well as the impact of high variability on decisions by foraging animals. We conducted experiments to determine the effect of nectar removal on nectar production. Nectar removal via simulated legitimate visits had no impact on total production in flowers of Pavonia, Isertia, and Palicourea. For A. sinclairiana and Pentagonia, total nectar production in visited flowers was reduced compared to unvisited flowers. Data from individuals of these last two species indicated that the population-level pattern was assembled from individuals that responded differently to nectar removal; clearly, understanding the evolution of nectar traits demands data from individuals. We argue that detecting patterns of plant responses to nectar removal requires the context of floral characteristics (e.g., longevity, ovule number, or pollinators). Nectar removal via simulated nectar-robbing visits had no impact on total nectar production in A. sinclairiana but reduced total production in Isertia. Nectar robbing did not cause plants to invest more energy in nectar than they would have the absence of robbing. Finally, we found no difference in seed set by robbed and unrobbed flowers of A. sinclairiana. Our results add to a growing body of literature suggesting that nectar robbers are not always detrimental to plant fitness.

AB Community-based conservation (CBC) is based on the idea that if conservation and development could be simultaneously achieved, then the interests of both could be served. It has been controversial because community development objectives are not necessarily consistent with conservation objectives in a given case. I examined CBC from two angles. First, CBC can be seen in the context of paradigm shifts in ecology and applied ecology. I identified three conceptual shifts-toward a systems view, toward the inclusion of humans in the ecosystem, and toward participatory approaches to ecosystem management-that are interrelated and pertain to an understanding of ecosystems as complex adaptive systems in which humans are an integral part. Second, I investigated the feasibility of CBC, as informed by a number of emerging interdisciplinary fields that have been pursuing various aspects of coupled systems of humans and nature. These fields-common property, traditional ecological knowledge, environmental ethics, political ecology, and environmental history-provide insights for CBC. They may contribute to the development of an interdisciplinary conservation science with a more sophisticated understanding of social-ecological interactions. The lessons from these fields include the importance of cross-scale conservation, adaptive comanagement, the question of incentives and multiple stakeholders, the use of traditional ecological knowledge, and development of a cross-cultural conservation ethic.

AB Invasion by nonnative brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) often results in replacement of cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki) in the-inland western United States, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. We conducted a four-year removal experiment to test for population-level mechanisms (i.e., changes in recruitment, survival, emigration, and immigration) promoting invasion success of brook trout and causing decline of native Colorado River cutthroat trout (O. c. pleuriticus). We chose 700-1200 in segments of four small mountain streams where brook trout had recently invaded cutthroat trout populations, two each at mid elevation (2500-2700 m) and high elevation (3150-3250 m), and annually removed brook trout from two streams (treatments), but not the other two (controls). We used depletion electrofishing, two-way fish weirs, and mark-recapture methods to estimate abundance, movement, and survival of trout. At mid elevation, age-0 and age-1 cutthroat trout survived at 13 times and two times higher rates on average, respectively, where brook trout were removed. At high-elevation sites, recruitment of cutthroat trout failed despite brook trout removals, apparently because of cold water temperatures. In contrast, age-2 and older cutthroat trout survived at similar rates, whether brook trout were removed or not and regardless of elevation. Summer movement by cutthroat trout was unaffected by removal of brook trout. We conclude that brook trout depress cutthroat trout populations at mid elevation through age-specific biotic interactions that reduce juvenile cutthroat trout survival, whereas populations restricted to high-elevation sites by invasion continue to decline because an abiotic factor (low temperature) causes recruitment failure. In comparison, brook trout survived at the same or higher rates than same-aged cutthroat trout. High immigration by brook trout recolonized depleted segments, and may help sustain invasions in sink habitats where environmental conditions limit recruitment. In streams similar to those we studied, eradication of brook trout is likely necessary to eliminate the threat to native cutthroat,trout, but selective removal regimes that capture a high percentage of the brook trout population for least three consecutive years, repeated periodically, may permit cutthroat trout populations to persist with brook trout. To identify underlying mechanisms responsible for successful invasion by mobile, age-structured vertebrates such as stream fishes, experiments conducted at realistic spatial and temporal scales and including multiple age classes will be required.

AB A theory for the 'edge of chaos' (EOC) in ecological systems is presented. The theory envisions that the essential ecological interactions can be described as a coupling of two basic predator-prey oscillators: one involving a specialist predator and the other a generalist predator. Three population dynamic models, which are obtained by coupling these oscillators, display 'edge of chaos' in parameter space. Additionally, one of the models helps us understand an interesting population dynamic phenomenon (short-term recurrent chaos) recently observed in vole populations of northern Fennoscandia. copyright 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB Extrafloral (EF) nectar resources can affect the dynamics of species interactions at the community scale. Furthermore, selection acting on EF nectary traits may extend beyond simple mutualisms between plants and the enemies of herbivores to involve other community members that use EF nectar. We examine how EF nectaries influence and are influenced by interactions with multiple species, highlighting our review with original data from the association between ants and wild cotton (Gossypium, thurberi). Our survey of the literature suggested that EF nectar attracts a diverse assemblage of arthropods and may enhance the diversity and abundance of arthropod assemblages. However, experimental evidence on the importance of EF nectar to terrestrial food webs was equivocal. Exploring potential avenues for selection, we uncovered several costs and benefits of EF nectary traits that have received little empirical attention. These include a constraint faced by plants when attracting both pollinators and protectors via nectar, as well as an ecological cost of nectar when herbivores consume EF nectar as adults. Finally, we discuss how geographic variation in multispecies interactions may affect selection on EF nectary traits. In wild cotton, variation among populations in EF nectar composition was consistent with the benefits afforded by attracting ants; however, non-ant species may also mediate spatially variable selection on EF nectaries. Our synthesis underscores a need for studies that manipulate EF resources at the community level and investigate selection on EF nectaries in a multispecies and geographic context.

AB The majority of species interact with at least several others. We develop simple genetic models of coevolution between three species where interactions are mediated by quantitative traits. We assume that one of the species has two quantitative traits, each of which governs its interaction with one of the other two species. We use this model to explore how genetic correlations between the two traits in the multivariate species shape the evolutionary dynamics and outcomes of three species interactions. Our results suggest that genetic correlations are most important when at least one of the interactions is between a predator and prey or parasite and host. In these cases, genetic correlations between traits lead to a wide variety of novel coevolutionary outcomes and dynamics. In particular, genetic correlations can affect the existence and stability of coevolutionary equilibrium points, and they can lead to recurrent or permanent maladaptation. When the three species interact only as competitors or mutualists, however, genetic correlations have no effect on the outcome of coevolution. In all cases, our results reveal the surprising conclusion that both positive and negative genetic correlations between traits have qualitatively identical effects on coevolutionary dynamics.

AB Habitat destruction is one of the primary causes of species extinction in recent history. Even if the destruction is restricted to a local area, its accumulation increases the risk of extinction. To investigate the effect of local habitat destruction, we studied two- and three-species model systems. The former contains prey (X) and predator (Y), while the latter is composed of X, Y and a top predator (Z). If the species Z goes extinct, then the latter becomes the former. Species dynamics are modeled within the lattice applying local and global interactions. Local interaction occurs between neighboring lattice points. In contrast, global interaction is allowed between any pair of lattice points, and its dynamics can be represented by the mean-field theory that is equivalent to Lotka-Volterra equation. Barriers, representing habitat loss, are randomly located between adjacent lattice points with the probability p. The barrier interrupts the reproduction of the prey X, but the predators Y and Z suffer no direct damage from the barriers. It is found that the effects of barriers on both species X and Y in the two-species model are usually opposite to those in the three-species model. Namely, if extinction occurs, the influence of habitat destruction on surviving species changes dramatically. We also find that when the density p of barriers increases the two models exhibit different extinction patterns: sometimes species X goes extinct, but sometimes the predator or top predator become extinct depending on the level of barrier density. The mean-field theory adequately predicts such species extinction, but it cannot explain some of the results. We interpret the results as an indirect relation between habitat destruction and species extinction. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ecosystem dynamics can be studied using model populations. Perturbation experiments have often been applied to simulated populations in order to study the uncertainty in ecosystem dynamics. Most of these studies have predicted a stationary state. We report on the uncertainty in the dynamics near extinction. In particular, we explore fluctuation enhancements, i.e., enhanced variability in dynamics of paths to extinction. We examine two dynamic models on a two-dimensional lattice of finite size: (1) the contact process (CP) in which interactions are restricted to occur between adjacent lattice points, and (2) mean-field simulation (MFS), where interactions occur globally, between any pair of lattice points. Computer simulation reveals that, for both CP and MFS, the random drift of density about a stationary state increases with the decrease of steady-state density. Drift is much more pronounced in the vicinity of the critical mortality rate, at the transition to extinction. Simulation demonstrates that MFS shows greater variability when relative mortality rate is low whereas CP shows much more pronounced variability when mortality is near the critical threshold. The CP process shows wider fluctuations while the MFS process shows minimal increases following perturbations that lead to extinction. Because interactions are local for CP, there are a variety of different paths to extinction. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Metabolism, and thus population dynamics, can be limited by energy, carbon, nitrogen, and/or other nutrients. This is due to homeostasis, the relatively constant composition of biomass. Yet growth-rate-dependent changes in the composition of biomass do exist. The dynamic energy budget (DEB) theory provides the framework to deal with these simultaneous limitations and stoichiometric restrictions. We illustrate the application with three examples. First, we discuss simple single-species growth of a chemolithoautotroph to illustrate the interactions between nutrients and substrates in growth. We show how the macrochemical reaction equation with variable yield coefficients can be decomposed in a number of subprocesses with constant yield coefficients. We then discuss a simple predator-prey System, where nutrients are accumulated in the prey, which no longer have a constant composition of biomass. The implication is a varying conversion efficiency from prey to predator, with consequences for qualitative aspects of population dynamics. We illustrate the principles with a grazer (a heterotrophic consumer) feeding on algae (autotrophic producers). The algae frequently have an excess of energy in the form of carbohydrates, which are excreted and serve as food supplements for the heterotroph. This exchange of carbohydrates against nutrients is basic to a symbiosis, our third example of-application of DEB theory for solving stoichiometric problems in species interactions. The algae are no longer grazed as long as the grazer is able to extract nutrients from other sources. Depending on parameter values of the system, the coexistence can be very stable and further integrate into a single entity with mixotrophic properties. This process is basic to the evolution of the eukaryotic cell and to the organizational structure of metabolism. Mixotrophs can specialize under particular environmental conditions into autotrophs or heterotrophs, which again can associate in symbiotic relationships. The chemical composition of membranes testifies to the frequent occurrence of this process, which can now also be understood quantitatively.

AB Although specialization in species interactions has usually been equated to reciprocal specialization, asymmetric specialization (i.e., a specialist interacting with a generalist) is also likely. Recent studies have suggested that asymmetric specialization in species interactions could be more common than previously thought. We contrasted patterns of asymmetric specialization observed in 18 plant-pollinator interaction webs with predictions based on null models. We found that asymmetric specialization is common in plant-pollinator interactions, and that its occurrence is more frequent than expected under a simple null model that assumed random interactions among species; furthermore, large assemblages with many pairs of,interacting species tend to have more asymmetric interactions than smaller assemblages. A second null model, which incorporated a correlation between species frequency of interaction and degree of specialization observed in most data sets produced patterns that were generally closer to those present in the data. At least three kinds of explanations could account for the observed asymmetric specialization, including random interactions among individuals (rather than species), adaptive consequences of specialization, and artifacts, such as data aggregation and sampling biases. Future studies should be aimed at understanding the relative importance of each of these alternative explanations in generating asymmetric specialization in species interactions.

AB Though established populations of invasive species can exert substantial competitive effects on native populations, exotic propagules may require disturbances that decrease competitive interference by resident species in order to become established. We compared the relative competitiveness of native perennial and exotic annual grasses in a California coastal prairie grassland to test whether the introduction of exotic propagules to coastal grasslands in the 19th century was likely to have been sufficient to shift community composition from native perennial to exotic annual grasses. Under experimental field conditions, we compared the aboveground productivity of native species alone to native species competing with exotics, and exotic species alone to exotic species competing with natives. Over the course of the four-year experiment, native grasses became increasingly dominant in the mixed-assemblage plots containing natives and exotics. Although the competitive interactions in the first growing season favored the exotics, over time the native grasses significantly reduced the productivity of exotic grasses. The number of exotic seedlings emerging and the biomass of dicot seedlings removed during weeding were also significantly lower in plots containing natives as compared to plots that did not contain natives. We found evidence that the ability of established native perennial species to limit space available for exotic annual seeds to germinate and to limit the light available to exotic seedlings reduced exotic productivity and shifted competitive interactions in favor of the natives. If interactions between native perennial and exotic annual grasses follow a similar pattern in other coastal grassland habitats, then the introduction of exotic grass propagules alone without changes in land use or climate, or both, was likely insufficient to convert the region's grasslands.

AB Characteristics used to group species, and thus generalize ecological interactions, can aid in constructing predictive models in species-rich food webs. We tested whether size could be used to predict a behavioral response of multiple prey species (n > 50) to exclusion of large-bodied fishes, including seven abundant piscivore species, in a lowland Neotropical river. A randomized block design (n = 6) included three experimental treatments constructed on sandbank habitats: large fish exclusion, cage control (barrier with gaps), and natural reference plot (no barrier). Exclosures prevented passage of all large-bodied fishes, but the mesh size allowed passage of prey fishes. After two weeks, experimental areas were sampled once during the day and once at night. Total abundance of prey fishes was not significantly different among treatments, and effects on species density were variable. Analyses based on fish size class, however, demonstrated significant size-based effects of large-fish exclusion. Abundance of medium fishes (40-110 mm) in exclusion treatments increased significantly relative to controls in day (248%) and night (91%) samples, and this trend was apparent for many species (n > 13). Species density of medium fishes increased significantly in exclusion treatments. There was evidence of an intraspecific, size-dependent response for the three most common species. Ninety percent of prey in stomach contents of seven common large-bodied piscivores (collected from river sandbanks) were 40-110 mm, corresponding to size of fishes that responded to large-fish exclusion.. Behavioral responses of medium prey likely resulted from exclusion of these large-bodied piscivores. These results extend size-based predator avoidance behavior demonstrated in temperate systems to a highly connected tropical river food web. In this species-rich web, size is a strong predictor of behavioral responses of multiple prey species to large piscivores, and it can be used to generalize outcomes of multiple species interacting simultaneously.

AB We tested the biological cause of density-dependent mortality in the bridled goby (Coryphopterus glaucofraenum), a small coral reef fish, and evaluated whether this knowledge allowed us to detect density dependence at different spatial scales in natural habitats. To identify the biological cause of density dependence, we manipulated both population density and the availability of shelter (crevices used as refuges from predators) in small plots of continuous reef. We detected strong density-dependent mortality in plots with few refuges, but mortality was density independent in plots with abundant refuges, indicating that limited shelter causes density dependence. Predator density was unrelated to the density of gobies and refuges, suggesting that predators displayed a type III functional response in patches with few refuges. In a second experiment, we manipulated goby density within replicate plots of three sizes (4, 16, and 64 m(2)) that varied naturally in the availability of refuges. If refuge availability was ignored, mortality appeared to be density independent at all scales. If, however, plots were grouped by refuge availability, mortality was density dependent in plots with few refuges, but low and density independent in plots with many refuges at all spatial scales. Understanding the mechanism of density dependence (refuge shortage) was thus required to measure the strength of density dependence in natural, spatially variable, habitat. We suggest that density dependence was detectable in plots of different sizes because the relationships between the densities of gobies, refuges, and goby predators were similar across the spatial scales we studied. Our work demonstrates that identifying the biological interactions that cause density dependence, and characterizing the spatial domains at which those interactions operate, will be important to accurately assess the effects of density dependence on population dynamics.

AB Epilithic biofilms play a key role in marine ecosystems. They also provide a tractable system to investigate the relative roles of environmental stressors, bottom-up physicochemical factors and top-down biological control in regulating communities. Patterns of photosynthetic microbial biomass were recorded over a four-year period at several tidal levels on shores in the Isle of Man. Photosynthetic biomass and the abundance of diatoms were consistently greater during winter than summer. Biomass Was negatively correlated with insolation stress and air temperature, but was not correlated with grazing intensity, dissolved nutrients, sea temperature, or planktonic chlorophyll. Field experiments confirmed that reducing insolation stress led to substantial increases in photosynthetic biomass, predominantly of diatoms and macroalgal germlings. Reducing grazing intensity also led to considerable increases in photosynthetic biomass, but reducing desiccation stress or increasing nutrient availability had no effect. Although grazing can regulate microalgal biomass, seasonal patterns of grazing activity were driven by temperature and were decoupled from photosynthetic biomass. Our study demonstrates the importance of physiological stresses for the direct and indirect regulation of the balance between primary producers and consumers. Based on these findings, we present a model that combines the roles of stressors together with bottom-up forcing and top-down regulation in controlling communities on wave-exposed shores.

AB 1. Predictions about how species will respond to climate warming are based commonly on eco-physiological models or niche models. One critique of this practice is that it ignores interspecific interactions.
   2. We examined how resource competition affects the responses of two ciliate species, Colpidium striatum Stein and Paramecium tetraurelia Sonneborn, to warming in laboratory microcosms.
   3. We found that warming had a negative effect on Colpidium abundance and a negligible effect on Paramecium abundance in the absence of interspecific competition. When Colpidium and Paramecium competed, however, Paramecium coexisted with Colpidium at low and high temperatures, and was competitively excluded at intermediate temperatures.
   4. Temperature-dependent strength of the interaction between Colpidium and Paramecium may explain the unexpected responses of Paramecium, which were inconsistent with its response to temperature in the absence of Colpidium.
   5. Our results provide further support for the important role of species interactions in understanding how species respond to environmental warming, and suggest that the complex interplay between species interactions and climate may make it extremely difficult to predict accurately how species embedded in complex communities will respond to climate warming.

AB The influence of biotic interactions in structuring macroinfaunal communities of exposed sandy beaches, an unstable habitat characterized by strong physical forces, is generally considered negligible. We investigated the hypothesis that competitive interactions during burrowing could potentially affect the intertidal distribution and abundance of macroinfaunal animals of sandy beaches using two species of invertebrates, a hippid crab, Emerita analoga, and a bivalve, Mesodesma donacium, common along the coast of Chile. Spatial overlap in the intertidal distributions of these species was dynamic, varying with abundance, location, time of year and tide. Highest density zones of each species were often distinctly separated at low tide and spatial overlap in their distributions decreased significantly with increasing density, suggesting density dependence of the interactions. Negative relationships between densities of the two species at the smallest spatial scale examined also suggested active interactions among individuals. Over a tidal cycle, peak densities of the two species overlapped suggesting that interactions could occur frequently. Burrowing performance of E. analoga varied between size classes in three experimental densities of clams (5, 10 and 15 clams 0.008 m(-2)) and in controls with no clams. Burrowing times of large crabs were significantly longer (similar totwofold) in all densities of clams than in controls, while those of small crabs did not differ significantly among treatments and controls. Large crabs also displaced clams from the sand while burrowing suggesting that two mechanisms of direct interference can occur, both of which could increase exposure of individuals involved to active swash and transport across or along the beach with potentially negative consequences. Our results suggest that competitive interactions capable of affecting zonation and population and community biology on a number of scales can occur among burrowing macroinfauna on exposed sandy beaches. Those interactions could be more ecologically significant than previously appreciated and may contribute to patterns observed in community structure and zonation on sandy beaches. Our results illustrate the potential importance of negative biological interactions in a physically stressful environment.

AB Many dinoflagellate species form dormant resting cysts as a part of their life cycle, and in some freshwater species, hatching of these cysts can be delayed by the presence of water-borne signals from grazing zooplankton. Some marine dinoflagellates can form temporary cysts, which may function to resist unfavourable short-term environmental conditions. We investigated whether the marine dinoflagellate Alexandrium ostenfeldii is able to induce an increased resistance to the parasitic flagellate Parvilucifera infectans by forming temporary cysts. We performed several laboratory experiments where dinoflagellates were exposed either to direct contact with parasites or to filtered water from cultures of parasite-infected conspecifics (parasite-derived signals). Infection by P. infectans is lethal to motile A. ostenfeldii cells, but temporary cysts were more resistant to parasite infection. Furthermore, A. ostenfeldii induced a shift in life-history stage (from motile cells to temporary cysts) when exposed to parasite-derived water-borne signals. The response was relaxed within a couple of hours, indicating that A. ostenfeldii may use this behaviour as a short-term escape mechanism to avoid parasite infection. The results suggest that intraspecies chemical communication evoked by biotic interactions can be an important mechanism controlling life-history shifts in marine dinoflagellates, which may have implications for the development of toxic algal blooms.

AB Here, we develop an approximate solution to the classical Lotka-Volterra two-species differential equation with application to plant system interactions. The model seeks to estimate the threshold species densities necessary for the native/crop, woody stemmed species (e.g. cottonwood; Populus deltoids and willow; Salix goodinigii, for western riparian systems) to 11 out-compete" the exotic/weed species (salt cedar; Tamarix ramosissima and Russian olive, Elaegnus angustifolia) and thereby reduce them. Explicitly our goal is to predict to what degree must one reduce the exotics/weed species and increase the native/crop to achieve a plant interaction system that leads to long-term reduction of the exotic/weed species. Preliminary results of predicted results compared with field data for a Loblolly pine (Pinus taeda)/opportunistic hardwood species interaction indicate that the analysis provides plausible results. Similar computations using a Douglas-fir/tanoak interaction show analogous behavior. Although, it is clear that a considerable level of research effort has been applied to woody stemmed, exotic/weed species ecology, we believe our approach involving close coupling between classical mathematical species competition models (Lotka-Volterra) and a field management predictive capability. As the necessity for quantitative planning tools becomes fundamental to many ecosystem restoration programs, models such as developed here may provide a useful first approximation.

AB Ecological interactions are often difficult to observe or manipulate directly, making it a challenge to evaluate competing hypotheses in natural systems. Semiparametric models can provide a powerful inverse approach to infer population processes from observational data because they allow an ecologist to model aspects of a system that are known, but allow the data to "speak for themselves" with regard to aspects that are unknown. However, (st)age- structured semiparametric models are plagued with demographic instabilities that can cause different combinations of interactions, including competing hypotheses, to predict the observed pattern equally well. We developed and tested two new solutions to these demographic instabilities that expand the range of life histories for which (st) age- structured semiparametric inverse methods can be used. We begin by reviewing the range of inverse methods, from fully parametric models in which the governing functions are completely specified, to semiparametric models that replace these functions with nonparametric curves. We illustrate how the demographic instabilities emerge and indicate the requirements that any successful solution must satisfy. Existing solutions use constraints that may conflict with ecological processes and cause strong biases in the inferred rates. Our first solution uses a new statistical constraint that is less restrictive than previous methods. Our second solution is a hybrid approach that supplements the less restrictive statistical constraint with a few estimates of the interaction rates. This hybrid approach provides a way of distinguishing among dynamical mechanisms without imposing constraints on ecological relationships.

AB Despite recognition of the significance of both food web interactions and habitat complexity in community dynamics, current ecological theory rarely couples these two processes. Experimental manipulations of the abundance of the two predators in an oyster-reef trophic cascade, and the structural complexity provided by reefs of living oysters, demonstrated that enhanced habitat complexity weakened the strengths of trophic interactions. The system of tri-trophic interactions included oyster toadfish (Opsanus tau) as the top predator that consumed the mud crab (Panopeus herbstii), which preys upon juvenile oysters (Crassostrea virginica). On reefs of low complexity, toadfish controlled mud crab abundances and indirectly determined the level of mortality of juvenile oysters. The indirect effects of toadfish on oysters emerged through their influence on how intensely mud crabs preyed on oysters. Augmentation of habitat complexity by substituting vertically oriented, living oysters for the flat shells of dead oysters disrupted both of the direct trophic linkages but did not alter the magnitude of the indirect effect of toadfish on juvenile oysters. This paradox can be understood by partitioning the mechanisms by which toadfish influence mud crabs and ultimately juvenile oysters. Trait-mediated indirect interactions (TMIIs; i.e., predator-avoidance behavior in mud crabs) accounted for 95.6-98.2% of toadfish indirect benefits to oyster survival and, consequently, were a much greater contributor than density-mediated indirect interactions (DMIIs; i.e., the reduction in crab abundance by toadfish). Avoidance behavior was unaffected by modification in habitat complexity. Complex reefs increased total oyster survival because added habitat complexity reduced mud crab predation on oysters. Additionally, the magnitude of this effect was much greater than the increase in oyster mortality as a result of complex reefs disrupting toadfish predation on mud crabs. This experimental demonstration of how habitat complexity modifies trophic interactions in a temperate reef community has fundamental implications for our understanding of species interaction webs and community structure. The influence of habitat complexity on the strength of a trophic cascade generally may depend upon whether physical complexity provides actual and perceived refuges for component predator-prey pairs.

AB Several recent studies suggest that community composition can take on alternate, apparently stable, states. For the most part, these studies are observational in nature and have not shown that alternate states arise from the order of species arrival during community assembly. Previous studies also provide little insight into the mechanisms that create alternate states, especially when direct species interactions, rather than environmental feedback, control their formation. We conducted experiments in identical physical environments to show that differences in the sequence of community assembly can create alternate species compositions that persist for many generations. Assembly sequence determined whether experimental food webs contained a single intraguild predator, or two intraguild predators. When the intraguild predator, Blepharisma americanum, became established in communities before the introduction of Tetraltymena vorax, combined effects of resource depletion and intraguild predation prevented the establishment of Tetrahymena. In contrast, when Tetrahymena preceded Blepharisma, both species frequently coexisted. Supporting experiments describe the exploitative competitive abilities of both intraguild predators, document the population dynamics of each species in less complex community modules, and determine the ability of Tetrahymena to invade Blepharisma cultures in the absence of competing prey. These results show that both competition and predation contribute to the formation of two alternate community states and confirm that one stable state resists transformation to the other.

TI Taking trophic cascades up a level: behaviorally-modified effects of
   phorid flies on ants and ant prey in coffee agroecosystems

AB Trophic cascades exist in numerous terrestrial systems, including many systems with ants as the top predator. Many studies show how behavioral modifications of herbivores are especially important in mediating species interactions and trophic cascades. Although most studies of trophic cascades focus on predator-herbivore-plant links, the trophic cascades concept could be applied to almost any level of trophic interactions. Especially considering the importance of parasites we consider here the interactions between the parasitic phorid fly, Pseudacteon sp. (Diptera: Phoridae), its ant host, Azteca instabilis (F. Smith) (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), and the herbivore, Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in the coffee agroecosystem. We investigated the effects of phorid flies on ant behavior by monitoring ant recruitment to tuna baits over a 30-min period in the presence or absence of phorid flies. To study the indirect effects of phorids on larvae, we placed baits on coffee plants to elevate ant foraging levels to levels near to ant nests, placed larvae near baits, and recorded the effects of ants on larvae either in the presence or absence of phorid flies. We found that phorid fly presence significantly reduced ant ability to recruit to baits through behavioral modifications and also significantly lessened ant ability to attack, carry away, or force herbivores off plants. We conclude there is a behaviorally-modified species-level trophic cascade in the coffee agroecosystem, with potentially important effects in ant and herbivore communities as well as for coffee production.

AB Climatic change has been implicated as the cause of abundance fluctuations in marine fish populations worldwide, but the effects on whole communities are poorly understood. We examined the effects of regional climatic change on two fish assemblages using independent datasets from inshore marine (English Channel, 1913-2002) and estuarine environments (Bristol Channel, 1981-2001). Our results show that climatic change has had dramatic effects on community composition. Each assemblage contained a subset of dominant species whose abundances were strongly linked to annual mean sea-surface temperature. Species' latitudinal ranges were not good predictors of species-level responses, however, and the same species did not show congruent trends between sites. This suggests that within a region, populations of the same species may respond differently to climatic change, possibly owing to additional local environmental determinants, interspecific ecological interactions and dispersal capacity. This will make species-level responses difficult to predict within geographically differentiated communities.

AB The effects of forest fragmentation on species richness, size and stability of bird mixed-species flocks were studied during rainy and dry seasons at nine Atlantic Forest fragments in Minas Gerais state, southeastern Brazil. Two distinct kinds of mixed-species flocks were identified at the study area: heterogeneous flock and understory flocks. The first type of association was observed in all forest fragments and was composed mainly of canopy and midstory species, but may include a few understory species. Understory flocks were composed mainly of understory species and were detected in only three forest fragments. Forest fragment area and season significantly affected species richness, size and stability of heterogeneous flocks. Moreover, species richness in heterogeneous flocks was correlated with total species pool in forest fragments. Species richness and size of understory flocks were different among the three forest fragments, but season influenced only flock size. Understory flock stability differed neither among forest fragments nor between seasons. The red-crowned ant-tanager Habia rubica was the nuclear and leader species of understory flocks, and determined the occurrence of this association in forest fragments. Our results show that forest fragmentation can affect species' interactions in foraging associations, and that conservation plans for the region should preserve nuclear species of mixed-species flocks and their preferred habitats.

AB Habitat fragmentation can have consequences on plant reproduction through several interactions with insects. We studied the effects of habitat fragmentation in the proportion of aborted, predated and undamaged seeds of Acacia aroma and Cercidium praecox. We performed this study in the Chaco Serrano of Argentina. We found that fragmentation effects differed between species. In small patches, the number of aborted seeds of A. aroma increased and the number of pre-dispersal predated seeds and undamaged seeds of C praecox decreased and increased, respectively. However, higher numbers of aborted seeds in small patches did not lead to fewer available seeds for dispersion. For these species, seed predation by bruchids was about 35 percent and aborted seeds were around 7 percent. Because of the elevated levels of damage and the high specificity of bruchids, the changes caused by habitat fragmentation may be very important for the populations of these two species. Habitat fragmentation effects on pollination and predispersal seed predation of these legumes may determine higher availability of seeds for dispersion in fragmented habitats.

TI Habitat fragmentation and biodiversity collapse in neutral communities
SO ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY
LA English
DT Article
AB Models of habitat fragmentation have mainly explored the effects on a few-species ecologies or on a hierarchical community of competitors. These models reveal that, under different conditions, ecosystem response can involve sharp changes when some given thresholds are reached. However, perturbations, recruitment limitation and other causes may prevent competitive hierarchies from actually operating in natural conditions: the process of competitive exclusion underlying hierarchies could not be a determinant factor structuring communities. Here we explore both spatially-implicit and spatially-explicit metapopulation models for a competitive community, where the colonization-extinction dynamics takes place through neutral interactions. Here species interactions are not hierarchical at all but are somehow ecologically equivalent and just compete for space and resources through recruitment limitation. Our analysis shows the existence of a common destruction threshold for all species: whenever habitat loss reaches certain value a sudden biodiversity collapse takes place. Furthermore, the model is able to reproduce species-rank distributions and its spatially explicit counterpart predicts also species-area laws obtained from recent studies on rainforest plots. It is also discussed the relevance of percolation thresholds in limiting diversity once the landscape is broken into many patches. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Aim This study aims to explain the patterns of species richness and nestedness of a terrestrial bird community in a poorly studied region. Location Twenty-six islands in the Dahlak Archipelago, Southern Red Sea, Eritrea.
   Methods The islands and five mainland areas were censused in summer 1999 and winter 2001. To study the importance of island size, isolation from the mainland and inter-island distance, I used constrained null models for the nestedness temperature calculator and a cluster analysis.
   Results Species richness depended on island area and isolation from the mainland. Nestedness was detected, even when passive sampling was accounted for. The nested rank of islands was correlated with area and species richness, but not with isolation. Idiosyncrasies appeared among species-poor and species-rich islands, and among common and rare species. Cluster analysis showed differences among species-rich islands, close similarity among species-poor and idiosyncratic islands, and that the compositional similarity among islands decreased with increasing inter-island distance. Thus, faunas of species-poor, smaller islands were more likely to be subsets of faunas of species-rich, larger islands if the distance between the islands was short.
   Main conclusions Species richness and nestedness were related to island area, and nestedness also to inter-island distances but not to isolation from the mainland. Thus, nestedness and species richness are not affected in the same way by area and distance. Moreover, idiosyncrasies may have been the outcome of species distributions among islands being influenced also by non-nested distributions of habitats, inter-specific interactions, and differences in species distributions across the mainland. Idiosyncrasies in nested patterns may be as important as the nested pattern itself for conservation - and conservation strategies based on nestedness and strong area effects (e.g. protection of only larger islands) may fail to preserve idiosyncratic species/habitats.

AB Plant traits can affect ecological interactions between plants, herbivores, and predators. Our study tests whether reduced leaf wax in peas alters the interaction between the pea aphid <LF>(Acyrthosiphon pisum), a foliar-foraging predator (a lady beetle, Hippodamia convergens) and a ground-foraging predator (a ground beetle, Poecilus scitulus). We performed a 2x2x2 factorial experiment in which wax level, presence of H. convergens, and presence of P. scitulus were manipulated. Experimental arenas consisted of a cage surrounding three pea plants. One plant in each cage was stocked with 15 pea aphids. In greenhouse and field cage experiments, we assessed the effect of each factor and their interactions on aphid density. As in previous studies, H. convergens foraged for aphids more effectively on reduced wax peas than on normal peas. Other interactions among H. convergens, P. scitulus , and A. pisum were the same on both types of peas. We consider how aphid movement, plant growth, and a high frequency of predation by P. scitulus on H. convergens influenced pea aphid density.

AB Here we describe a practical, step-by-step primer to scale-dependent correlation (SDC) analysis. The analysis of transitory processes is an important but often neglected topic in ecological studies because only a few statistical techniques appear to detect temporary features accurately enough. We introduce here the SDC analysis, a statistical and graphical method to study transitory processes at any temporal or spatial scale. SDC analysis, thanks to the combination of conventional procedures and simple well-known statistical techniques, becomes an improved time-domain analogue of wavelet analysis. We use several simple synthetic series to describe the method, a more complex example, full of transitory features, to compare SDC and wavelet analysis, and finally we analyze some selected ecological series to illustrate the methodology. The SDC analysis of time series of copepod abundances in the North Sea indicates that ENSO primarily is the main climatic driver of short-term changes in population dynamics. SDC also uncovers some long-term, unexpected features in the population. Similarly, the SDC analysis of Nicholson's blowflies data locates where the proposed models fail and provides new insights about the mechanism that drives the apparent vanishing of the population cycle during the second half of the series.

AB Generalist parasites may disproportionately use certain hosts because of different benefits associated with each host species. I measured the growth rate of the marine snail Trichotropis cancellata, a facultative kleptoparasite that can suspension feed and steal food, on different hosts to determine the relative nutritional benefits of each host. The variation in tentacle (feeding structure) area among the hosts studied had the potential to provide parasitic snails with different amounts of nutrition for growth. In field experiments, suspension-feeding snails isolated from potential hosts grew at a similar rate to snails on brachiopods and significantly more slowly than snails on the following polychaete worms: Serpula columbiana (Serpulidae), Pseudopotamilla ocellata (Sabellidae), Schizobranchia insignis (Sabellidae), and Eudistylia vancouveri (Sabellidae). However, choice among worm hosts affected snail growth rates only in the fall, when phytoplankton levels are low. At this time, snails parasitizing the sabellids Schizobranchia and Eudistylia grew more quickly than snails on Serpula. In the spring and summer, with high levels of phytoplankton, Trichotropis grew at similar rates on all worm species tested. Trichotropis spent approximately the same time stealing food from each worm host species, >50% of the time the worms had their tentacles extended (the difference among hosts was not significant). This finding demonstrates that the similarity of snail growth rates on different worm species is not due to the snails compensating for poor hosts (worms that provide food at a slower rate) by spending more time stealing food. Snails in choice experiments preferred live Serpula to empty Serpula tubes, indicating that at least some of the cue(s) snails use to identify hosts are derived from living host tissues. In choice racks containing live Serpula and live Schizobranchia, snails did not choose one host worm significantly more often than the other. Because Trichotropis grows faster on sabellids than serpulids in the fall, I predicted that snails in nature would infect sabellids more often than other species. However, snails were usually distributed randomly among host species. In the few cases where the snails showed a significant preference among host species, proportionally more snails were found on serpulids than on sabellids or sabellarids. This study is the first to quantify under natural conditions the growth benefits of a kleptoparasite across the range of possible hosts, and implies that factors other than growth rate influence host choice specificity in the marine kleptoparasite T. cancellata.

AB Empirical studies have shown that, in real ecosystems, species-interaction strengths are generally skewed in their distribution towards weak interactions. Some theoretical work also suggests that weak interactions, especially in omnivorous links, are important for the local stability of a community at equilibrium. However, the majority of theoretical studies use uniform distributions of interaction strengths to generate artificial communities for study. We investigate the effects of the underlying interaction-strength distribution upon the return time, permanence and feasibility of simple Lotka-Volterra equilibrium communities. We show that a skew towards weak interactions promotes local and global stability only when omnivory is present. It is found that skewed interaction strengths are an emergent property of stable omnivorous communities, and that this skew towards weak interactions creates a dynamic constraint maintaining omnivory. Omnivory is more likely to occur when omnivorous interactions are skewed towards weak interactions. However, a skew towards weak interactions increases the return time to equilibrium, delays the recovery of ecosystems and hence decreases the stability of a community. When no skew is imposed, the set of stable omnivorous communities shows an emergent distribution of skewed interaction strengths. Our results apply to both local and global concepts of stability and are robust to the definition of a feasible community. These results are discussed in the light of empirical data and other theoretical studies, in conjunction with their broader implications for community assembly.

AB We explore geographical variation in the density relationship between potential competitor forest bird groups, resident Parus spp. and migrant Fringilla spp., across Europe using published bird census results. In addition, we summarized results from three experimental studies from northern Europe on their density associations. Based on anticipated changes in the relative intensity of positive and competitive interactions we predicted a unimodal density association between Parus and Fringilla: at low and intermediate densities the two groups are positively associated (positive interaction), whereas high densities promote interspecific competition. In central Europe where densities are high, densities were unimodally related to each other. In northern and southern Europe linear and positive associations appeared. Experimental studies provided consistent support for positive interspecific interactions in the north. The results suggest that species interactions may indeed vary in relation to the density of potential competitor and switch from positive to negative along environmental gradients.

AB We investigate adaptive diversification in experimental Escherichia coli populations grown in serial batch cultures on a mixture of glucose and acetate. All 12 experimental lines were started from the same genetically uniform ancestral strain but became highly polymorphic for colony size after 1000 generations. Five populations were clearly dimorphic and thus serve as a model for an adaptive lineage split. We analyzed the ecological basis for this dimorphism by studying bacterial growth curves. All strains exhibit diauxie, that is, sequential growth on the two resources. Thus, they exhibit phenotypic plasticity, using mostly glucose when glucose is abundant, then switching to acetate when glucose concentration is low. However, the coexisting strains differ in their diauxie pattern, with one cluster in the dimorphic populations growing better in the glucose phase, and the other cluster having a much shorter lag when switching to the acetate phase. Using invasion experiments, we show that the dimorphism of these two ecological types is maintained by frequency-dependent selection. Using a mathematical model for the adaptive dynamics of diauxie behavior, we show that evolutionary branching in diauxie behavior is a plausible theoretical scenario. Our results support the hypothesis that, in our experiments, adaptive diversification from a genetically uniform ancestor occurred due to frequency-dependent ecological interactions. Our results have implications for understanding the evolution of cross-feeding polymorphism in microorganisms, as well as adaptive speciation due to frequency-dependent selection on phenotypic plasticity.

AB 1. Each of the multiple environmental cycles - the light-dark, tidal, semilunar, lunar and seasonal cycles - may have an independent, specific effect on reproductive timings of marine organisms and can alone or in combination produce a variety of temporal reproductive patterns. Assuming that each ecological interaction with these fluctuating environmental cycles generates a unique functional relationship between a component of fitness and the timing of reproduction, a model is proposed that predicts that all fitness components are multiplicative and therefore the reproductive timing is entrained or driven by a cycle(s) having a sharp functional curve of the relevant fitness component.
   2. According to this model, many of the reproductive patterns, ranging from diel to lunar, commonly seen in marine organisms were explained by changing relative kurtosis among functional curves of fitness components. Each curve could also differ in its optimum and skewness, making various intermediates and modifications possible.
   3. As a model system for the model to be applied, intraspecific variation in the timing of spawning by a puffer, Takifugu niphobles (Jordan & Snyder) was examined. The patterns of daily variation in a day's spawning time within a population and geographical variation in spawning days among populations indicated that (1) the semilunar cycle (i.e. spring-neap tide cycle) has no direct influence on spawning days, (2) a combination between the functional curves of the fitness components associated with the light-dark and tidal cycles produce an apparent biweekly, semilunar spawning rhythm, (3) the curves may be skewed toward earlier and later times, respectively, and (4) their form may differ among populations.
   4. This model approach argues that to understand the ecology and evolution of temporal patterns of reproduction, one must properly decouple and evaluate the form of the functional curve of a fitness component associated with each of the multiple environmental cycles.

AB 1 Habitat fragmentation and the resulting decline in population size can affect biotic interactions and reproductive success of plant species. We investigated the impact of habitat type, population size, morph type and frequency, plant density, floral display and predation on different reproductive components in 16 populations of the distylous self-incompatible perennial herb, Primula vulgaris, a rare, declining species in Belgium.
   2 Although habitat type accounted for significant variation in population size, we did not find any relation between habitat type and either reproductive and vegetative characteristics. Population size, however, strongly affected reproductive success, such that plants in small populations produced significantly fewer fruits per plant and seeds per fruit, and therefore fewer seeds per plant.
   3 No significant difference was found between morph types for any reproductive characteristic, nor an interaction with population size. However, when morph frequency was strongly biased (greater than or equal to1:3), the proportion of flowers setting fruit and the number of seeds per fruit were significantly lower in individuals of the common morph type.
   4 Within populations, individual plants varied tremendously in size and floral display. Total number of fruits per plant significantly increased with floral display, but the highest fruit set per flower was found at intermediate flower number.
   5 The proportion of fruit suffering pre-dispersal predation per plant significantly increased with floral display, but this did not offset the potential fitness gains of producing a large display. Furthermore, the absolute number of predated fruits per plant was significantly and positively affected by the interaction of the total number of fruits per plant and the density of the population.

AB The shrub Buxus sempervirens and the trees Abies alba and Fagus sylvatica have recently recolonized old-pastures in the Central Pyrenees. We mapped all live and dead individuals (> 1.3 m tall) in a large forest plot in Ordesa Valley to examine the importance of density-dependent processes during recolonization. Biotic interactions were inferred from changes in horizontal structure and the influences of neighbours on tree survival. Buxus differentially influenced establishment and survival of tree species, thereby controlling future canopy composition and spatial structure. The rapidly invading Abies formed denser patches on elevated sites less occupied by Buxus. whereas Fagus preferentially established within shrubs. Abies reached densities which led to intense intraspecific competition and high mortality rates among saplings. Self-thinning in Abies led to smaller numbers of regularly spaced survivors, and greater relative dominance of Fagus. Disregarding intraspecific effects and abiotic environment, Abies survival was significantly lower under Buxus shrubs. which suggests that the spatial location and abundance of Abies was constrained by the location of Buxus. Fagus survival was not related to Buxus density, but remained significantly lower in denser Abies patches. The higher mortality of Fagus in denser Abies patches, and the resulting spatial segregation of the species, reflects asymmetric interspecific competition. Inhibition from Buxus shrubs and intraspecific competition prevent invading Abies from dominating and may therefore help in maintaining a mixed Abies-Fagus stand.

AB Environmental heterogeneity can promote coexistence of conflicting species by providing spatial or temporal refuges from strong interactions (e.g., intraguild predation, competition). However, in many systems, refuge availability and effectiveness may change through time and space because of variability in habitat use by either species. Here I consider how the intensity of intraguild predation risk varies from day to night for aquatic insects that use both vegetated and open water habitats. Large (1,265 l) and small (42 l) mesocosms were used to test the hypothesis that Buenoa would choose an open-water habitat that minimized predation by the ambush predator Notonecta during the day, but that at night Buenoa would safely use both vegetated and open water. Regardless of container size, Notonecta remained in vegetated water during the day and exploited both habitats at night, despite exhibiting greatest instantaneous predation rates in open water during the day. In contrast, Buenoa maintained an even distribution throughout the mesocosms during day and night, even though habitat-specific predation risks were fivefold lower in open waters than in vegetation during the day and habitat-specific predation risk would have been reduced threefold by fully exploiting open waters. Thus, temporal heterogeneity was both beneficial and detrimental to Buenoa; darkness of night reduced predation, but spatial refuges also disappeared. Together, these patterns suggest that while environmental heterogeneity can dampen intense biotic interactions, enemies do not select habitats solely on the basis of conflict avoidance. Instead, it appears that habitat-specific variation in other biotic (e.g., visual predators) or physical factors (e.g., UV radiation) may also mediate species interactions by influencing habitat selection.

AB The relative importance of abiotic factors in community assembly is debated and thought to be dependent on the scale. I investigated the relative role of topography and soils as structuring agents at the landscape and the community scales in 126 subalpine calcareous grasslands in the Pyrenees, in terms of species composition and abundance. I wished to know: (1) the role of abiotic factors in the organization of plant communities across the landscape; (2) how much of the variation in community distribution was accounted for by abiotic factors; and (3) how well their role applied to the distribution of dominant species at the landscape and the community scales. The hypothesis was: abiotic factors play an important rote in community distribution in the Landscape, but species interactions are more important within communities. Multivariate methods generated four communities, organized in two contrasting groups along the main vegetation axis, which explained 13% of the variation: mesic grasslands (Nardus stricta and Festuca nigrescens communities) and xeric grasslands (Carex humilis and Festuca gautieri communities). Mesic communities were more acidic and fertile than xeric communities. Changes in the abiotic environment, accounting for up to 80% of the variation in the vegetation, were smooth, while the transition between xeric and mesic grasslands was sharp in terms of species composition. The distribution in the Landscape of the first main species from each community was closely related to abiotic factors, which modeled poorly the abundance of the main species at smaller scales. At the within-community scale, the explanatory power of biotic relationships was community dependent, producing the most significant models for plants highly dominant within their communities, such as N. stricta and F gautieri. Contrary to current hypothesis, there was a shift from mainly positive relationships among dominant species in fertile mesic communities to mainly negative in infertile xeric ones.

AB Soil communities in landscapes that are rapidly changing due to a range of anthropogenic processes can be regarded as highly transient systems where interactions between competing species or trophic levels may be seriously disrupted. In disturbed communities dispersal in space and time has a role in ensuring continuity of community function. Stable communities, in undisturbed systems, are more dependent on competition and other biotic interactions between species. We predicted how food web components would respond to disturbance, based on their dispersal and colonizing abilities. During decomposition, flows of energy and nutrients generally follow either a bacterial-based path, with bacteria as the primary decomposer and bacterial-feeding fauna and their predators forming the associated food web, or a fungal-based channel. Trophic links that were generally resistant to change were the organisms of the bacterial. pathway that have high abilities to disperse in time and passively disperse in space. Organisms in the fungal pathway were less resistant to disturbance. Resource inputs to the soil system are derived from plants, either through root exudation and root turnover during active growth or from dead plant material following senescence or agricultural tillage. Disturbances to the soil system can arise as a direct action on the soil, or indirectly from effects on the above-ground plant community. Disturbance-induced changes in plant community composition will change the soil food web composition. Organisms involved in direct interactions with plants (e.g. AM-mycorrhizal fungi) were also predicted to be vulnerable to disturbance. (C) 2004 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB Recent research has generally shown that a small change in the number of species in a food web can have consequences both for community structure and ecosystem processes. However 'change' is not limited to just the number of species in a community, but might include an alteration to such properties as precipitation, nutrient cycling and temperature, all of which are correlated with productivity. Here we argue that predicted scenarios of global change will result in increased plant productivity. We model three scenarios of change using simple Lotka-Volterra dynamics, which explore how a global change in productivity might affect the strength of local species interactions and detail the consequences for community and ecosystem level stability. Our results indicate that (i) at local scales the average population size of consumers may decline because of poor quality food resources, (ii) that the strength of species interactions at equilibrium may become weaker because of reduced population size, and (iii) that species populations may become more variable and may take longer to recover from environmental or anthropogenic disturbances. At local scales interaction strengths encompass such properties as feeding rates and assimilation efficiencies, and encapsulate functionatty important information with regard to ecosystem processes. Interaction strengths represent the pathways and transfer of energy through an ecosystem. We examine how such local patterns might be affected given various scenarios of 'global change' and discuss the consequences for community stability and ecosystem functioning. (C) 2004 Elsevier GmbH.

AB Numerous field studies show that changing environmental conditions and ecological interactions within complex food webs can influence the dynamics of populations. Nonetheless, the potential benefit of understanding and predicting this variation to manage harvesting rarely has been considered. Here we develop analytic approximations to explore the relationship between the proportion of variation in annual recruitment that can be predicted and the expected annual harvest yield arising from fixed escapement harvesting methods. Simulations suggest that these approximations are reliable, provided that the unpredicted variance in recruitment is not large and the escapement threshold is set below carrying capacity. As an example of how these approximations may be applied, we use demographic and environmental data from a trapped population of martens (Martes americana) in Ontario to evaluate the effect on harvest yield of improvements in prediction of recruitment based on fluctuations in its prey base. We conclude that realistic improvements in forecasting of recruitment lead to only a modest increase in the average annual harvest and increase the variation in realized harvests, but could substantially reduce the risk of over-harvesting when escapement levels are set low.

AB The relative importance of regional and local processes in determining community structure is a long-standing problem in community ecology. This is especially problematic in communities from highly connected habitats, which undergo two opposing forces: differences in environmental conditions of the habitats lead to divergence of the communities, while the dispersal of individuals leads to convergence of the communities. Using a transplant experiment, we experimentally showed that biotic interactions, have a predictable, deterministic impact on zooplankton community structure in a metacommunity of highly interconnected shallow ponds. Fish predation and presence of abundant macrophyte cover. rapidly structured regional communities of zooplankton, both in terms of relative abundances and of cladoceran species richness. Moreover, we could use the relations between the experimentally manipulated environmental conditions and the observed experimental communities to successfully classify the contrasting local communities found in the original neighboring ponds, thus directly relating the experimental results to the actual field situation. Notwithstanding the observed strong impact of local biotic conditions, we also showed that dispersal had an influence on community structure and species richness. Dispersal increased species richness of cladocerans by three species and influenced zooplankton community structure. More-over, dispersal actually made the response to local conditions more deterministic.

AB While two cyprinid fishes introduced from nearby drainages have become widespread and abundant in the Eel River of northwestern California, a third nonindigenous cyprinid has remained largely confined to less than or equal to25 km of one major tributary. (the Van Duzen River) for at least 15 years. The downstream limit of this species, speckled dace, does not appear to correspond with any thresholds or steep gradients in abiotic conditions, but it lies near the upstream limits of three other fishes: coastrange sculpin, prickly sculpin, and nonindigenous Sacramento pikeminnow. We conducted a laboratory stream experiment to explore the potential for emergent multiple predator effects to influence biotic resistance in this situation. Sculpins in combination with Sacramento pikeminnow caused greater mortality of speckled dace than predicted based on their separate effects. In contrast to speckled dace, 99% of sculpin survived trials with Sacramento pikeminnow, in part because sculpin usually occupied benthic cover units while Sacramento pikeminnow occupied the water column. A 10-fold difference in benthic cover availability did not detectably influence biotic interactions in the experiment. The distribution of speckled dace in the Eel River drainage may be limited by two predator taxa with very different patterns of habitat use and a shortage of alternative habitats.

AB We examined whether dung beetle species shift their habitat associations (vegetation types) with different climatic conditions, using altitudinal and seasonal gradients as analogues of future climate change scenarios. Dung beetle assemblages in Picos de Europa (northern Spain) were monitored by dung-baited pitfall trapping in three vegetation types (woodland, heathland, and pasture), three altitudinal zones (520-600 m, 950-963 m, and 1,230-1,275 m) and during two different seasons (summer and autumn) in 1994. Most species shifted their habitat use on the altitudinal and seasonal gradient in response to changes in microclimatic conditions (temperature). They were generally associated with heathland and woodland (shaded habitats) at lower altitudes, but they were increasingly associated with pastures (open habitat) as altitude increased. There was also a greater association with pastures in the coldest season (autumn) and with heathland and woodland in the warmest season (summer). These results suggest that climate change could be a major factor influencing habitat selection in dung beetles. The magnitude of habitat shifts was species specific, so climate warming also has the potential to generate new or different species interactions. The research presented here supports the feasibility of using microclimatic gradients within a region to study the potential effects of future climate change on both species and communities.

AB Aim investigate the formation of nestedness and species co-occurrence patterns at the local (sampling station), the intermediate (island group), and the archipelago scale.
   Location The study used data on the distribution of terrestrial isopods on 20 islands of the central Aegean (Greece). These islands are assigned to two distinct subgroups (Kyklades and Eastern islands).
   Methods The Nestedness Temperature Calculator was used to obtain nestedness values and maximally nested matrices, the EcoSim7 software and a modified version of Sanderson (2000) method were used for the analysis of species co-occurrences. Idiosyncratic temperatures of species and the order of species placement in the maximally nested matrices were used for further comparisons among spatial scales. The relationships of nestedness values with beta-diversity, habitat diversity and a number of ecological factors recorded for each sampling station were also investigated.
   Results Significant nestedness was found at all spatial scales. Levels of nestedness were not related to beta-diversity or habitat diversity. Nestedness values were similar among spatial scales, but they were affected by matrix size. The species that contributed most to the nested patterns within single islands were not the same as those that produce nestedness at the archipelago scale. There was significant variation in the frequency of species occurrence among islands and among spatial scales. There was no direct effect of ecological factors on the shaping of patterns of nestedness within individual islands, but habitat heterogeneity was crucial for the existence of such patterns. Positive associations among species prevailed at all scales when species per station were considered, while negative associations prevailed in the species per island matrices. All associations resulted from the habitat structure of sampling stations and from particularities of geographical distributions.
   Conclusions There was no clear-cut distinction between nestedness patterns among spatial scales, even though different species, and partially different factors, contributed to the formation of these patterns in each case. There was a core of species that contributed to the formation of nested patterns at all spatial scales, while the patterns of species associations suggested that biotic interactions are not an important causal factor. The results of this study suggest that locally rare species cannot be widespread at a higher spatial scale, while locally common species can have a restricted distribution.

AB The land snail genus Mandarina has undergone extensive radiation within the Bonin Islands in the west Pacific. The preferred above-ground vegetation heights of sympatric species were clearly different. They separated into arboreal, semi-arboreal, exposed ground and sheltered ground ecotypes. Shells of species with different ecotypes differ markedly, but shells of species with the same ecotype are very similar to each other. Shell morphologies of some phylogenetically distantly related species with the same ecotype were indistinguishable. Character evolution estimated parsimoniously using a phylogenetic tree suggests that the speciation among sympatric species is accompanied by ecological and morphological diversification. In addition, species coexistence of Mandarina is related to niche differentiation. The above findings suggest that ecological interactions among species contribute to the ecological and morphological diversification and radiation of these land snails in this depauperate environment.

AB Long-term herbaceous response data following herbicidal treatment of honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa Torr.) are needed to develop more accurate projections regarding economic feasibility of these treatments and to model ecological interactions between woody and herbaceous plants in rangeland systems. Our objective was to measure herbaceous yield and mesquite regrowth 10 or 20 years after mesquite was aerially sprayed with either mesquite top-killing or root-killing herbicides. Treatments evaluated included mesquite top-killing herbicides at 10-12 years (T10) and 19-21 years (T20) post-treatment, mesquite root-killing herbicides at 10-12 years (R10) and 19-21 years (1120) post-treatment, and an untreated control where mesquite were >30 years old (C30). Treatments were applied in the late 1970's or late 1980's. Grass yields, measured annually from 1998 through 2000, were quantified within patches of 3 perennial grass functional groups: cool-season mid-grasses, warm-season mid-grasses, or warm-season short-grasses. Cool-season annual grass yields were also quantified within these perennial grass patches. By 1998, mesquite canopy cover was 55, 47, 36, 24, and 12% in C30, T20, T10, R20, and R10 treatments, respectively. Warm-season mid-grass yields were most sensitive to differences in mesquite cover in all 3 years and declined sharply when mesquite cover exceeded 30%. Cool-season mid-grass yields declined slightly with increasing mesquite cover. Warm-season short-grass and cool-season annual grass yields were not related to mesquite cover, except in 2000 when warm-season short-grass yield beneath mesquite canopies increased with increasing mesquite cover. Results suggest that herbicide treatment life (defined by increased perennial grass yield in response to mesquite treatments) was at least 20 years for the root-killing herbicide, but no longer than 10 years for the top-killing herbicide.

AB The shrimp Rimicaris exoculata dominates the megafauna of some Mid-Atlantic Ridge hydrothermal vent fields. This species harbours a rich bacterial epibiosis inside its gill chamber. At the 'Rainbow' vent site (36degrees 14.0'N), the epibionts are associated with iron oxide deposits. Investigation of both bacteria and minerals by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray microanalysis (EDX) revealed 3 distinct compartments in the gill chamber: (1) the lower pre-branchial chamber, housing bacteria but devoid of minerals; (2) the 'true' branchial chamber, containing the gills and devoid of both bacteria and minerals; and (3) the upper pre-branchial chamber, housing the main ectosymbiotic bacterial community and associated mineral deposits. Our chemical and temperature data indicated that abiotic iron oxidation appears to be kinetically inhibited in the environment of the shrimps, which would explain the lack of iron oxide deposits in the first 2 compartments. We propose that iron oxidation is microbially promoted in the third area. The discrepancy between the spatial distribution of bacteria and minerals suggests that different bacterial metabolisms are involved in the first and third compartments. A possible explanation lies in the modification of physico-chemical conditions downstream of the gills that would reduce the oxygen content and favours the development of bacterial iron-oxidizers in this Fe-II-rich environment. A potential role of such iron-oxidizing symbionts in the shrimp diet is suggested. This would be unusual for hydrothermal ecosystems, in which most previously described symbioses rely on sulphide or methane as an energy source.

AB The effects of human exploitation on macroecological patterns have received little attention, although such investigations may highlight unique spatial and temporal changes characteristic of species and assemblages subject to persistent disturbance. In unexploited systems (mainly among temperate avifauna) positive relationships between local abundance and geographic distribution are prevalent for individual species through time (intraspecific pattern) and among species during fixed time periods (interspecific pattern). We investigated intraspecific and interspecific relationships for 24 common marine fishes on the Scotian Shelf and Bay of Fundy, Canada, some of which have been commercially exploited for several decades. Based on extensive fisheries-independent trawl survey data from 1970 to 2001, 16 of the 34 stocks, comprising 13 species, exhibited significant positive intraspecific relationships. Significant relationships were associated mainly with those stocks that demonstrated significant temporal trends in both abundance and geographic distribution. The time-averaged (32 yr) interspecific relationship was positive and significant at the largest scale examined. Significant annual interspecific relationships were also detected over 26 yr. Surprisingly, the slopes of the annual relationships increased systematically and doubled through time, probably due to size-selective exploitation, shifting target species, and associated species interactions. In contrast to previous studies, our results indicate that the contributions of individual species to the interspecific relationship can change through time, and these changes dramatically alter the interspecific abundance-distribution relationship. Temporal trends in the interspecific relationship have not previously been reported, and appear to be due to the large spatial- and temporal-scale effects of exploitation.

AB Environmentally induced variability in recruitment rates can result in population variability in both space and time. However, fluctuations in population sizes are also governed by species interactions. While both these processes have been widely explored, fewer efforts have been made to investigate their combined effects. The goal of this study was to investigate how environmentally induced recruitment variability combines with species interactions to influence the structure and dynamics of a simple multi-trophic rocky intertidal community. We first simulated spatial differences and temporal fluctuations in larval supply and subsequent recruitment, and found that the effects of temporal variability on community stability depended on spatial differences in mean larval supply. Next, we explored how removal of specific species influenced these patterns. These simulations showed that predatory and competitive interactions can have contrasting effects on community stability in response to recruitment variability, which depend on the life history of the predator. Our results show the difficulty of isolating questions of community response to spatial and temporal recruitment variability from each other or from a consideration of community structure in general.

AB We studied spatial and temporal patterns in foraging activity among diurnal birds and nocturnal mammals at a semiarid site in northern Chile using artificial foraging trays. Small mammals foraged more extensively under shrubs than in open microhabitats, but birds showed no such selection. Moreover, avian foraging was more extensive than that by small mammals in all seasons and both microhabitats. Avian foraging was highly seasonal, as many birds at our site migrate to the Andean prepuna or to Patagonia during the austral summer. Birds have tended to be overshadowed by small mammals and ants in studies of granivory, but this study suggests that their importance may be underestimated in some systems.

AB This study describes assemblages of predatory ground beetles in native birch forest and derived blueberry farms on the Lower Mainland of British Columbia and investigates their role in the successful biological control of winter moth (Operopthera brumata L.) by the parasitoid Cyzenis albicans Fallen. Pitfall traps at four sites in 1991 and 1992 indicated that natural birch forest was dominated by native carabid species, while open blueberry was dominated by introduced species and some native xerophilous species. Predation by generalist invertebrates was an important mortality factor for both winter moth and C. albicans at all sites and was greatest in the first 2 weeks after pupation. Ground beetles including Harpalus affinus (Schrank) and Pterostichus spp. consumed winter moth pupae in arenas but adult beetles rarely consumed C. albicans pupae. Much of the overall predation was due to smaller invertebrates including beetle larvae. Predators actively searched for buried pupae and selected among pupae types based on condition (dead, parasitised or healthy) and size. Prey-selection differed among sites but C. albicans pupae were preferred at three of the four sites. At the remaining site, an organic blueberry farm, over 90% of both parasitised and healthy pupae were consumed. High levels of predation did not affect the levels of parasitism by C. albicans at the sites. This herbivore-parasitoid-predator system demonstrates the importance of naturally occurring predatory invertebrates for successful integrated pest management, even where they prey upon a biological control agent.

AB Many factors influence which plant species are found in a particular wetland. The species pool is composed of the species present in the seed bank and species able to disperse into the wetland, and many abiotic and biotic factors interact to influence a species performance and abundance in the plant community. Anthropogenic activities produce specific stressors on wetland systems that alter these abiotic and biotic interactions, potentially altering species composition. We simulated three common wetland hydrogeomorphic (HGM) subclasses in a greenhouse to examine the effects of two stressors-sedimentation and nitrogen (N) enrichment-on the performance of 8 species grown in artificial communities. Species establishment, height, biomass, and foliar N and P concentrations were measured to explore species responses to stressors and competition, as well as the potential impacts of changes in species composition on ecosystem processes. Species were affected differently by sedimentation and N enrichment, and there were differences in overall community sensitivity to stressors between wetland subclasses. Sedimentation generally reduced seedling establishment, while N enrichment produced variable effects on height and biomass. Interspecific competition had little effect on establishment but significantly reduced most species biomass. Sedimentation generally lowered community biomass, diversity, and richness, while enrichment increased community biomass. Establishment, biomass, and foliar nutrient concentrations significantly differed between many species, suggesting that shifts in species composition may impact ecosystem processes such as nutrient cycling and carbon storage. Phalaris arundinacea, an aggressive clonal graminoid, universally dominated all wetland subclasses. This dominance across a range of environmental conditions (sedimentation, fertility, and hydrology) has important implications for both restoration and predicting the impacts of human activities on species composition. Our results suggest that, in regions where R arundinacea is common, restoration projects that establish communities from seeds and human activities that cause vegetation removal are likely to become dominated by P. arundinacea.

AB The relationship between predator and prey is dependent on resource availability, the predators' hunting strategy, the prey's suite of antipredatory mechanisms, and the complexity of the habitat. We conducted a laboratory experiment to evaluate background preferences by tadpoles of Bufo woodhousii Girard and the predaceous water bug Belostoma lutarium St (a) over circlel (Hemiptera: Belostomatidae). Our results indicate that 1) tadpoles switched preference away from black backgrounds when a chemical signal from B. lutarium was introduced, 2) earlier stage tadpoles exhibited a stronger effect than later stage tadpoles in the presence of the predator's chemical signal, 3) hemipterans were observed randomly on both backgrounds but were mostly found associated with vegetative cover, and 4) B. lutarium killed significantly more tadpoles on dark backgrounds compared to light backgrounds.

AB Individual-based and state variable-based adaptive agents (AA) are discussed regarding their relevance to different types of ecosystems. Individual-based AA proved applicable to a spatially explicit simulation of highly simplified terrestrial food webs. State variable-based AA with evolutionary computation (EC) embodied are suggested for the simulation of aquatic food webs and plankton species interactions. Embodiment of EC in AA can be achieved by evolving predictive rules (ER), differential equations (EDE) or artificial neural networks (ANN) derived from a diverse lake database. In order to provide ecosystem simulation with resilience to environmental change, agent banks can be created containing alternative agents for same species or functional groups from different lakes. State variable-based AA are currently tested for aquatic ecosytem simulation by means of a diverse lake database. It promises to overcome constraints by the rigidity of traditional lake ecosystem models. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We used null model analyses to investigate the existence of structure in lizard assemblages from open vegetation enclaves in Rond (o) over cap nia, southwestern Amazonia, in relation to species richness, species co-occurrence, diet, and size overlap. These enclaves presumably have been isolated since the Holocene, providing a history of long-term isolation. We assumed that the presence of structure in lizard assemblages from the Rond ($) over cap onia enclaves is consistent with the notion that extinctions are a deterministic process, some species being more prone to extinction than others. We grouped enclaves into four categories: latosoil cerrado, sandy cerrado, transitional forest, and rocky field. We collected 14 Cerrado lizard species, consisting of five families in all sampled areas. Analyses of species richness, co-occurrence, diet overlap, and size overlap patterns suggested lack of organization in the assemblages. The assemblages from the rocky fields of Guajara-Mirim and the sandy cerrados in Vilhena were significantly structured in diet overlap, whereas the remaining assemblages lacked structure. This probably resulted from phylogenetic inertia and not from ecological interactions. Our results suggest that extinctions proceeded in a stochastic fashion and that historical factors had a dominant role in shaping lizard assemblages in detriment of present-day ecological factors. In addition, we identified endemic species in the enclaves as well as a tight association between unique ecogeographic features of the landscape and species occurrences. We propose that conservation measures in the region must adequately preserve these features to ensure the survival of the species.

AB Alteration of riparian stream flow through the damming of rivers and streams impacts not only river morphology but also the vegetation communities that exist within the confines of a river's banks. To examine changes in vegetation community composition and structure resulting from human control of water flow, I conducted a series of surveys on dammed and undammed streams in the Eastern Sierra Nevada Mountains of California. These surveys documented that areas below dams contain increased leaf litter and, grass thatch deposition, increased grass species coverage, and an altered community of existing forbs as compared to sites with naturally flowing streams. There was also an increased woody species canopy coverage as distance from the stream increased. To examine the proximal causes of damming on herbaceous plants, I set up a factorial field experiment examining the impact of grass thatch, shading, and herbivory on a common riparian species, Mimulus guttatus, the common monkeyflower. M. guttatus germination was decreased in the thatch augmentation plots and under artificial shading. For seedlings, shading increased final plant height and thatch increased herbivory. In plots where herbivory was not controlled by insecticide, M. guttatus plants grew smaller and had lower reproduction. I also repeated this experiment in a more controlled greenhouse environment using two seed sources and two levels of shading coverage. Results from this experiment largely confirm patterns seen in the field, but also revealed a strong interaction between shading and thatch treatments for both germination and growth. Overall, my results suggest that altering riparian stream flow may impact plant performance through a cascading set of biotic interactions, and that controlled releases from dams that mimic bankfull or greater discharge events may be required to restore these important and diverse communities by resetting disturbance rates.

TI Making long-term economic growth more sustainable: evaluating the costs
   and benefits
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article

ID NATURAL-RESOURCES; ENVIRONMENT; VULNERABILITY
AB Currently, traditional development issues such as economic stagnation, poverty, hunger, and illness as well as newer challenges like environmental degradation and globalisation demand attention. Sustainable development, including its economic, environmental and social elements, is a key goal of decisionmakers. Optimal economic growth has also been a crucial goal of both development theorists and practitioners. This paper examines the conditions under which optimal growth might be sustainable, by assessing the costs and benefits of growth. Key environmental and social aspects are considered. The Ecol-Opt-Growth-1 model analyses economic-ecological interactions, including resource depletion, pollution, irreversibility, other environmental effects, and uncertainty. It addresses some important issues, including savings, investment, technical progress, substitutability of productive factors, intergenerational efficiency, equity, and policies to make economic growth more sustainable-a basic element of the sustainomics framework. The empirical results support growing concerns that costs of growth may outweigh its benefits, resulting in unsustainability. Basically, in a wide range of circumstances, long term economic growth is unsustainable due to increasing environmental damage. Nevertheless, the model has many options that can be explored by policy makers, to make the development path more sustainable, as advocated by sustainomics. One example suggests that government supported abatement programs are needed to move towards sustainable development, since the model runs without abatement were infeasible. The optimal rate of abatement increases over time. Abatement of pollution is necessary to improve ecosystem viability and increase sustainability. Further research is necessary to seek conditions under which alternative economic growth paths are likely to become sustainable. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Current theoretical models and field evidence suggest that facilitation and interference act simultaneously in the field, but there is little information on their joint dynamics under varying abiotic conditions. We evaluated spatial and temporal variations in the positive, negative, and net effects of the tussock grass Stipa tenacissima on the shrub Pistacia lentiscus in Mediterranean semiarid grasslands. We performed a field experiment in which positive (microclimatic amelioration and water inputs from runoff). and negative (belowground competition) effects were experimentally manipulated under contrasting levels of stress. The environment provided by S. tenacissima (tussock treatment) improved the survival and physiological status of planted P. lentiscus seedlings. The elimination of shade and competition from S. tenacissima significantly decreased and increased, respectively, seedling performance as compared to the tussock treatment. We found evidence that microclimatic amelioration is the main positive factor involved in the interaction under study, and that it can balance the negative effects of belowground competition. The latter was also important, especially after major rainfall events. In contrast with previous studies, both the water inputs from runoff and the soil chemical fertility were found to have a relatively weak effect in the interaction under study. The net effect of S. tenacissima on P. lentiscus was always facilitative, but the magnitude of this effect increased with the harshness of the environmental conditions in both space and time. Despite this, the mechanisms underlying plant-plant interaction responded unequally to small-scale environmental variation. Our results agree with models suggesting that the magnitude of facilitation may increase under stressful conditions, and provide evidence of the dynamic nature of positive and negative interactions in the field.

AB The density-dependence inherent in population interactions can be undermined when the behavior or distribution of predators is not predictable from their population density. For instance, unequal use of space by consumers can lead to improper characterizations of their interaction with prey if based solely on population density. Instead, quitting harvest rates (QHRs) from resource patches might provide a useful alternative index of predator impacts. We tested whether space use would predict predation rates of white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) on experimental songbird nests and whether QHRs or mouse density would best predict the proportion of space used. Our results indicated that space use was an accurate predictor of nest predation rates. Moreover, space use was significantly related to QHRs, but not to mouse density. In our study, space use is the outcome of behavioral mechanisms that do not appear to scale with or lag behind consumer density. In such cases, we may expect a disjuncture between population density and species interactions.

AB To predict how species establish and disperse within novel communities, the spatial scale at which competition, predation, and habitat interact must be understood. We explored how these factors affect the distribution and abundance of the exotic crayfishes Orconectes rusticus and O. propinquus and the native O. virilis at both the site-specific and whole-lake scales in northern Wisconsin lakes. During summer 1990, we quantified crayfish, fish predators, and fish diets in cobble and macrophyte sites in Trout Lake, comparing resulting patterns to those in 21 lakes surveyed during summer 1987. Within and across lakes, fish abundance was unrelated to habitat. Within Trout Lake, O. rusticus and O. propinquus were common in both cobble and macrophyte. Orconectes virilis was restricted to macrophyte, probably due to strong displacement by the invaders in cobble. Across lakes, O. rusticus increased where habitat was more than 16.7% cobble, O. propinquus was generally rare, and O. virilis abundance was unrelated to cobble. Crayfish were generally small in cobble and large in macrophyte, perhaps because of habitat-specific, size-selective fish predation or because large crayfish leave cobble when it no longer provides refuge. Orconectes virilis, the largest of three congeners, may have a size refuge in macrophyte but not in. cobble. Across lakes, O. rusticus was only abundant when fish biomass was low; O. virilis abundance varied positively with fish.
   Effects of fish predation and habitat on the ability of invaders Orconectes rusticus and O. propinquus to establish and replace O. virilis appear to be scale dependent. At local (site-specific) scales, cobble likely interacts with selective predation for O. virilis to allow the invaders to establish and replace the native. At the lake-wide scale, high cobble facilitates invaders but predation may curb their successful dispersal and establishment at new sites. Models of community assembly and invasions need to incorporate scale dependencies in habitat availability and biotic interactions to effectively assess the invasion potential of novel species.

AB One explanation for the higher abundance of invasive species in their non-native than native ranges is the escape from natural enemies. But there are few experimental studies comparing the parallel impact of enemies (or competitors and mutualists) on a plant species in its native and invaded ranges, and release from soil pathogens has been rarely investigated. Here we present evidence showing that the invasion of black cherry (Prunus serotina) into north-western Europe is facilitated by the soil community. In the native range in the USA, the soil community that develops near black cherry inhibits the establishment of neighbouring conspecifics and reduces seedling performance in the greenhouse. In contrast, in the non-native range, black cherry readily establishes in close proximity to conspecifics, and the soil community enhances the growth of its seedlings. Understanding the effects of soil organisms on plant abundance will improve our ability to predict and counteract plant invasions.

AB Exotic grasses and grass-fueled fires have altered plant species composition in the seasonal submontane woodlands of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. These changes have altered both structural and functional aspects of the plant community, which could, in turn, have consequences for litter decomposition and nitrogen (N) dynamics. In grass-invaded unburned woodland, grass removal plots within the woodland, and woodland converted to grassland by fire, we compared whole-system fluxes and the contributions of individual species to annual aboveground fine litterfall and litterfall N, and litter mass and net N loss. We assessed the direct contribution of grass biomass to decomposition and N dynamics, and we determined how grasses affected decomposition processes indirectly via effects on native species and alteration of the litter layer microenvironment. Grasses contributed 35% of the total annual aboveground fine litterfall in the invaded woodland. However, total litterfall mass and N were not different between the invaded woodland and the grass removal treatment because of compensation by the native tree Metrosideros polymorpha, which increased litter production by 37% +/- 5% when grasses were removed. The 0.3 g N m(-2)/y(-1) contained in this production increase was equal to the N contained in grass litter. Litter production and litterfall N was lowest in the grassland due to the loss of native litter inputs. Decomposition of litterfall on an area basis was highest in the grass-invaded woodland. We attributed this effect to increased inherent decomposability of native litter in the presence of grasses because (a) the microenvironment of the three vegetation treatments had little effect on decomposition of common litter types and (b) M. polymorpha litter produced in the invaded woodland decomposed faster than that produced in the grass removal plots due to higher lignin concentrations in the latter than in the former. Area-weighted decomposition was lowest in the grassland due to the absence of native litter inputs. Across all treatments, most litter types immobilized N throughout the incubation, and litter net N loss on an area basis was not different among treatments. Our results support the idea that the effects of a plant species or growth form on decomposition cannot be determined in isolation from the rest of the community or from the direct effects of litter quality and quantity alone. In this dry woodland, exotic grasses significantly altered decomposition processes through indirect effects on the quantity and quality of litter produced by native species.

AB 1. Natural wetlands have traditionally been considered as efficient 'ecological engineers' for waste water treatment. However, the structure and function of many natural wetlands have been severely altered by the chronic exposure to pollutants, especially nutrients.
   2. Despite the similarity of symptoms of eutrophied shallow lakes and wetlands, restoration strategies differ distinctly between these rather similar aquatic systems. Many of the tools applied in shallow lake restoration programs, for example biomanipulation, have received little attention in wetland management and restoration.
   3. Although a strong conceptual basis for food web management exists, biotic interactions as influences on wetland communities have been largely neglected by wetland scientists and managers.
   4. In this paper we show that biomanipulation may have a strong potential for wetland eutrophication abatement. This potential will be demonstrated by reviewing studies carried out in different wetland types in contrasting climatic regions.
   5. We propose four different scenarios for when, where and why biomanipulation may be used to rehabilitate freshwater wetlands. These scenarios reflect different settings of hydrological variability, eutrophication sources and gradients of wind exposure and water colour.

AB 1 Most studies of salt marsh plant zonation have been at middle to high latitudes of the northern hemisphere, in euhaline or periodically hypersaline marshes with regular tides. In this study, we examined plant zonation in an irregularly flooded marsh in southern Brazil. Pore water characteristics were compared in four vegetation zones across a marsh elevation gradient. Reciprocal transplants between vegetation zones and removal experiments were performed to examine species interactions in low and mid marshes.
   2 There was no distinctive gradient of physical stress across the elevation of irregularly flooded low and mid marshes. Moreover, the three dominant plants, Spartina alterniflora, Spartina densiflora and Scirpus maritimus, were able to grow across the entire elevation gradient, i.e. within zones normally occupied by the other species. The only exception was Spartina alterniflora, which was strongly limited by selective herbivory by the crab Chasmagnathus granulata in the Scirpus maritimus zone.
   3 Although intra- and interspecific competition reduced growth of all three species, no competitive hierarchy was found in any vegetation zone.
   4 These results suggest that, as in tidal marshes of the north hemisphere, competition is important in structuring salt marsh plant communities. In contrast, however, plant zonation in irregularly flooded marshes cannot be explained by displacement of competitive subordinates to physically stressful habitats. The roles of founder effects and selective herbivory in such marshes therefore merits further investigation.

AB 1 We carried out a factorial experiment to examine how groundwater availability (low and high sites with intermediate or rare flooding), vegetation canopy, leaf litter and seed availability interacted to determine the species richness of a productive wet grassland community in Wicken Fen National Nature Reserve, Cambridgeshire, UK. Seeds of 18 species were added to half the plots in each of eight combinations of elevation, canopy and litter, and seedling emergence was observed for two growing seasons.
   2 Both individual and interactive effects on plant diversity and colonization were determined for all four examined factors. Interactive effects explained 41-63% of the total variation in both species richness and numbers of individuals growing from added seeds.
   3 Neither elevation nor vegetation canopy had significant individual effects on total species richness, but their interaction was significant. Litter addition limited seedling emergence at the low elevation but favoured it at the high elevation.
   4 The relative importance of vegetation canopy and plant litter in affecting plant community composition varied with the community parameter considered (species richness or number of seedlings), elevation and stage of vegetation development. In general, plant litter was more important in determining species richness, whereas the vegetation canopy was more important in determining seed germination and seedling emergence. Plant litter was also more important than vegetation canopy at an early stage of vegetation development and at low elevation.
   5 Seed availability was the most important factor in determining overall species richness in the studied community. The influence of the local seed bank was very limited. Seedling emergence and seedling species richness were generally enhanced by lower elevation and seed addition, but depressed by vegetation and litter addition.
   6 The complex relationships observed have considerable implications for ecological modelling and ecosystem restoration. Manipulation of one factor may produce unexpected effects on other factors, which may induce a series of consequences for the whole community. Further knowledge on how natural communities are organized and maintained is needed to guide the management of ecosystems.

AB This study deals with the habitat restriction of Mammillaria pectinifera, a threatened cactus species, confined to a few low density localities of the Tehuacan valley in tropical Mexico. We analysed the patterns of presence/absence of M. pectinifera in relation to the presence/absence of 48 other plant species, and the variation of environmental factors in 120 sampling plots. A Principal Components Analysis revealed a clear segregation between plots with and without individuals of M. pectinifera. A classification analysis resulted in four groups: two with low prevalence and two with high prevalence of M. pectinifera. Paired comparisons between plots with and without M. pectinifera allowed the characterization of its patterns of occurrence related to the variation of environmental factors. M. pectinifera was found on deep alkaline soils with relatively high surface stoniness and high water retention capacity, showing low species richness compared with plots where it was absent. The limited distribution of M. pectinifera in the Tehuacan Valley seems to be related to particular requirements of this species, being restricted to certain Suitable habitat patches. Nevertheless, it is likely that other aspects, such as poor dispersal and establishment abilities, or biotic interactions could be associated with the observed patterns.

AB Many previous studies have assumed that a linear relationship between local and regional species richness indicates that communities are limited by regional processes, while a saturating relationship suggests that species interactions restrict local richness. We show theoretically that the relationship between local and regional richness changes in a consistent fashion with assembly time in interacting communities. Communities show saturation in their early assembly stages because only a subset of the regional pool may colonize a locality. At intermediate assembly times, communities will appear unsaturated until significant competitive exclusion occurs. Finally, when communities reach equilibrium, we found saturation as a result of resource competition resulting in the dominance of a limited number of species. We show that habitat size and species fecundity are important in determining the time needed for the community to reach equilibrium and thus affect the relationship between local and regional species richness. Our results suggest the number of coexisting species is a function of local and regional processes whose relative influences might vary over time and that research using the relationship between local and regional species richness to infer mechanisms limiting species richness must have knowledge of the assembly time of the community.

AB One of the central goals in paleoecology is to understand the nature and consequences of biotic interactions. In marine systems, it has been argued that one of the major steps in the escalation of biotic interactions was marked by the origins of grazing fishes in the Cenozoic. Here I investigate the origins of herbivory and grazing in marine fishes using analyses of functional morphospace. Closing and opening lever ratios and relative length of the lower jaw are used to construct a plot of functional morphospace, a quantitative description of the potential feeding modes of fishes. Four fish faunas were examined, spanning the Mesozoic and Cenozoic (Triassic, Jurassic, Eocene and Recent). All three fossil faunas are from conservation Lagerstatten in the central Tethys, in the vicinity of coral reefs or coral-bearing hardgrounds. Changes in functional morphospace occupation reveal a marked shift in the Cenozoic, with the appearance of fishes with relatively small forceful jaws. In Recent faunas, this functional morphospace is occupied almost exclusively by grazing herbivores. This taxon-independent morphological signal of herbivory was lacking in the Mesozoic faunas, was first recorded in the Eocene, and persisted throughout the Cenozoic. This suggests that the Cenozoic did indeed witness the appearance and proliferation of herbivory and grazing by marine fishes. The arrival of these piscine herbivores had the potential to fundamentally alter the dynamics of benthic marine communities.

AB To address how habitat destruction and hierarchical competition among species affect the spatio-temporal dynamics of a multi-species community, we present a compartment model in which multiple species undergo dispersal and competitive interactions in a patchy habitat arranged in a two-dimensional lattice. We assume that disturbances are periodically imposed on some parts of the lattice in a block, followed by a period free of disturbance. For convenience, species are ranked in order of competitive ability. We further assume that the intrinsic growth rate of species i, epsilon(i), and the dispersal ability, D-i, increase in decreasing order of rank. Our model can analytically determine the exact number of surviving species when disturbance is absent. In the presence of disturbance, we numerically examine how spatio-temporal changes in environmental heterogeneity affect species coexistence and extinction, for the case in which the value of epsilon(i)/D-i monotonically increases or decreases with rank. The results demonstrate that (1) when the interspecific competition is smaller than the intraspecific competition, we can provide predictions on the prospective order of species to be driven extinct and the order of potential species to revive with increasing extents of disturbance; (2) when the interspecific competition is stronger than intraspecific competition, a small difference in the disturbance level can lead to drastic changes in the species composition, their densities and the order of species extinction. In addition, comparison with other similar models reveals that differences in species interaction in local population dynamics critically affect the disturbance-mediated species diversity.

AB The spatial structure and seasonal changes of estuarine fish assemblages in the Cienaga Grande de Santa Marta (CGSM) were analysed based on four seasonal comprehensive surveys conducted in 1993-1994 and 1997. Geostatistical and multivariate techniques were used to: (a) determine seasonal changes in spatial distribution of the species richness, and (b) identify assemblages of estuarine fish and their relation to abiotic factors. Potential biotic interactions affecting the assemblage structure were also explored. A total of 11075 individuals representing 39 species were collected, with Eugerres plumieri, Diapterus rhombeus, Micropogonias furnieri, Mugil incilis, Cathorops spixii, Elops saurus and Anchovia clupeoides as dominant species between seasons. Spatial distribution of fish richness differed between rainy and dry seasons in each year, whereas species mapping showed spatial patchiness in 1993-1994 and gradients during 1997. Strong evidence of species saturation was found in all seasons, suggesting biotic interactions limiting species richness at a threshold density of ca. 50 ind./5000 m(2). Marine, marine-estuarine and freshwater species were classified in each season according to their capability to cope with salinity fluctuations. Associations defined by functional feeding guilds were also identified. Empirical and statistic evidence showed that fish assemblages differed between seasons within each year, and each assemblage was always dominated by a small number of species, notably E. plumieri in both years 1993-1994 and 1997. Between-season differences in fish assemblage structure in the CGSM seem to be driven by abiotic factors; however, evidence of species saturation could suggest the existence of density-dependent factors operating together.

AB Invertebrate communities inhabiting deep-sea hydrothermal vents undergo substantial succession on time scales of months. Manipulative field experiments assessed the relative roles of environmental state and biotic interactions in determining temporal succession along a spatial gradient in vent fluid flux at three vent sites near 9degrees50' N on the East Pacific Rise (2500 in water depth). Species colonization patterns on cubic basalt blocks (10 cm on a side) deployed by the submersible Alvin revealed both positive (facilitation) and negative (inhibition) biological interactions, in the context of established succession theory. Over a series of four cruises from 1994 to 1998, blocks were exposed to colonists for consecutive and continuous intervals in short-term (5 + 8 = 13 mo) and longer-term (8 + 29 = 37 mo) experiments. Colonists grouped into a mobile functional group were less abundant in the continuous interval (13 mo) than in the synchronous pooled-consecutive intervals (5 + 8 mo) of the short-term experiment, indicating that early colonists inhibited subsequent recruitment. Colonists grouped into a sessile functional group exhibited the opposite pattern, indicating facilitation. Similar trends, though not statistically significant, were observed in the longer-term experiment. The character of species interactions varied along a gradient in hydrothermal fluid flux (and inferred productivity), with inhibitory interactions more prominent in zones with high temperatures, productivity, and faunal densities, and facilitative interactions appearing where temperatures, productivity, and densities were low; Analyses of primary succession on introduced basalt blocks suggest that biological interactions during early vent. community development strongly modify initial patterns of settlement, even in the absence of sustained temporal change in the vent fluid flux.

AB The pattern and process of seasonal changes in an intertidal annual algal assemblage were examined at Hiura, northern Japan. Short-term field experiments (<2 months' duration) were set up to quantify the effects of both grazing and pre-emption on species replacement in the assemblage in three different seasons. An 8-month field experiment was set up to quantify long-term effects, including the indirect effects of both grazing and competitive dominance on the community structure. Results suggested that seasonal change in the algal assemblage resulted from the interaction of abiotic environmental change, competition and grazing. The relative contribution of these factors varied within a short period, presumably as a result of seasonal changes in physical environmental stress, free space availability and grazing pressure. From February to March, when grazer density was low and there was much free space available for algae, the dominant species shifted from foliose green alga Monostroma angicava to filamentous red alga Bangia atropurpurea, because B. atropurpurea grew faster than M. angicava. This species replacement was not influenced strongly by biological interaction but by temporal changes in abiotic environmental conditions. From April to mid May, when there was less free space available for algae in the natural community, the dominant B. atropurpurea decreased with increasing foliose red alga Porphyra yezoensis, because only P. yezoensis was able to invade an area pre-empted by algae. Grazing did not affect this species replacement. After mid May, the two dominant species, P. yezoensis and B. atropurpurea, decreased. Their decline was mainly caused by desiccation stress and was partially affected by grazing.

AB The Alaskan tussock tundra is a strongly nutrient-limited ecosystem, where almost all vascular plant species are mycorrhizal. We established a long-term removal experiment to document effects of arctic plant species on ecto- and ericoid mycorrhizal fungi and to investigate whether species interactions and/or nutrient availability affect mycorrhizal colonization. The treatments applied were removal of Betula nana (Betulaceae, dominant deciduous shrub species), removal of Ledum palustre (Ericaceae, dominant evergreen shrub species), control (no removal), and each of these three treatments with the addition of fertilizer. After 3 years of Ledum removal and fertilization, we found that overall ectomycorrhizal colonization in Betula was significantly reduced. Changes in ectomycorrhizal morphotype composition in removal and fertilized treatments were also observed. These results suggest that the effect of Ledum on Betula 's mycorrhizal roots is due to sequestration of nutrients by Ledum, leading to reduced nutrient availability in the soil. In contrast, ericoid mycorrhizal colonization was not affected by fertilization, but the removal of Betula and to a lower degree of Ledum resulted in a reduction of ericoid mycorrhizal colonization suggesting a direct effect of these species on ericoid mycorrhizal colonization. Nutrient availability was only higher in fertilized treatments, but caution should be taken with the interpretation of these data as soil microbes may effectively compete with the ion exchange resins for the nutrients released by plant removal in these nutrient-limited soils.

AB Invertebrate prey have been shown to select suboptimal resource patches in the face of predation (the food-predation risk trade-off). The foraging strategy used by a predator and the environmental context under which an interaction occurs potentially mediates prey responses to predators. Here, I determined whether season, predator presence or alternative prey availability affected prey patch use when faced with a sit-and-wait predator from streams in southern Maine. In addition, instantaneous mortality rates and predator movement behavior were assessed as possible mechanisms explaining patch use by prey in different seasons. In the absence of predators, prey did not show any preference for substrate patches based on particle size. But, depending on prey type and season, substrate position in streams had a significant effect on prey survival. Mayflies survived most in summer when pebble substrates were located upstream whereas caddisfly survival was highest when pebble substrates were located downstream in winter. Season and taxa significantly affected instantaneous mortality rates, suggesting this predator responded differently to available prey in each season. Predators changed ambush positions in the streams significantly more during winter than during summer, both with and without prey present. The presence of caddisflies in mixed-prey trials reduced consumption of mayflies in summer, but increased their mortality in winter. Increased movement behavior of predators in winter may have led to greater encounters with prey, thus increasing winter mortality. Collectively, these data reveal season can influence the outcome of predator-prey interactions. Environmental context, as well as predation mode, is critical to predicting predation effects in macroinvertebrate communities. Further studies of the seasonal changes in organism-specific behavior are needed to evaluate the importance of biotic interactions in structuring stream communities.

AB A plant conservation programme is a complex process that requires several sets of studies.. The relationships between plant location and its environment play an important role. Nowadays, the use of a GIS constitutes an essential complement for these studies that allows the incorporation of space and the analysis of these ecological interactions. GIS. is being used at the Lisbon University Botanical Garden as a tool for conservation programmes on several plant groups and situations. Four case studies are presented in this work: (1) comparing ecological patterns between local and regional scale, for the endangered bryophyte Bruchia vogesiaca Schwaegr.; (2) selecting protected areas according to habitat suitability-the case of endangered Portuguese bryophytes; (3) analysing the impact of the alien Carpobrotus edulis (L.) N. E. Br. on endemic plant species at the Berlengas Natural Reserve; and (4) ecogeographical survey for selection of sites for seed collection in order to guarantee a representative sample of the existing genetic diversity. Finally, this work discusses how the implementation of a GIS can help to optimise results and fieldwork effort. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We discovered, using transfer functions, that climatic changes in the Atlantic control the abundance of Temora longicornis, a dominant pelagic copepod of the Baltic Sea. The seawater salinity was increasing and copepod numbers were high from 1960s up to 1970s. Then the freshwater runoff started to increase, which resulted in decreasing salinities and abundance of the copepod. At the end of 1990s, runoffs remained at a high level, and the decrease of surface salinities and Temora leveled off. Due to time lags between variables studied, we also make predictions of changes expectable in early 2000s. The total freshwater runoff to the Baltic Sea followed the North Atlantic Oscillation with an immediate lag. Salinity followed the runoff non-linearly with a lag of 4-9 months. Temora longicornis followed the salinity with a lag of 1-3 months. Predicted abundance of T. longicornis will remain low implicating poor feeding conditions for planktivores. Our study points out the importance of physical factors in control of pelagic environments compared to ecological interactions, such as top-down and bottom-up.

AB Corridors that connect patches of disjunct habitat may be promising tools for mediating the negative impacts of habitat fragmentation, but little is known about how corridors affect ecological interactions. In eight 12-ha experimental landscapes, we examined how corridors affect the impact of invertebrate, rodent, and avian seed predators on pokeweed, Phytolacca americana. Over 13 months in 2000 and 2001, we quantified the effects of patch shape, connectivity, and predator type on the number of seeds germinating in the field (germinants), seed removal, and the viability of remaining seeds.
   Corridors did not affect the number of P. americana germinants in experimental exclosures or the viability of seeds remaining in exclosures. However, corridors affected the removal of seeds in a predator-specific manner: invertebrates removed more seeds in unconnected patches, whereas rodents removed more seeds in connected patches. Seed removal by birds was similar in connected and unconnected patches. Total seed removal by all seed predators was not affected by corridors, because invertebrates removed more seeds where rodents removed fewer seeds, and vice versa. Overall, seed predation significantly reduced the number and viability of remaining seeds, and reduced the number of germinants in 2000 but not in 2001. The abundance of naturally occurring P. americana plants in our experimental patches in 2000 decreased with increasing seed removal from exclosures but was not related to viability or germinants in 2000, suggesting that seed removal may shape the distribution and abundance of this species.
   Complementary patterns of seed removal by rodents and invertebrates suggest that corridors alter the effects of these predator taxa by changing the relative amounts of edge and core (nonedge) habitats in a patch. Because invertebrates and rodents do not completely overlap in the seeds they consume, corridors may change predation pressure on seeds that are primarily consumed by one predator type, with potential consequences for the composition of plant and seed predator communities.

AB A new analysis of the nearly century-old Lotka-Volterra theory allows us to link species interactions to biodiversity patterns, including: species abundance distributions, estimates of total community size, patterns of community invasibility, and predicted responses to disturbance. Based on a few restrictive assumptions about species interactions, our calculations require only that the community is sufficiently large to allow a mean-field approximation. We develop this analysis to show how an initial assemblage of species with varying interaction strengths is predicted to sort out into the final community based on the species' predicted target densities. The sorting process yields predictions of covarying patterns of species abundance, community size, and species interaction strengths. These predictions can be tested using enrichment experiments, examination of latitudinal and productivity gradients, and features of community assembly.

AB Recent studies have shown that there are high degrees of spatial and temporal stability in coral reef fish assemblage structures in a continuous habitat, in contrast to results of observations in isolated habitats. In order to determine the reason for the difference in temporal stability of fish assemblage structures in a continuous habitat site and an isolated habitat site, population dynamics and spatial distributions of coral reef fishes ( six species of pomacentrids and two species of apogonids) in the two habitat site were investigated over a 2-year period in an Okinawan coral reef. The population densities of pomacentrid and apogonid species increased in juvenile settlement periods at both sites, but the magnitude of seasonal fluctuation in population density was significantly greater at the isolated habitat site, indicating that the rate of juvenile settlement and mortality rate in the isolated habitat were greater than those in the continuous habitat. The magnitude of aggregation of fishes, which affects density-dependent biological interactions that modify population density such as competition and predation, was also significantly greater at the isolated habitat site, especially in the juvenile settlement season. Most of the fishes at the isolated habitat site exhibited more generalized patterns of microhabitat selection because of less coral coverage and diversity. The seasonal stability in the species composition of fishes was greater at the continuous habitat site than that at the isolated habitat. Our findings suggest that the relative importance of various ecological factors responsible for regulation of the population density of coral reef fishes (e.g., competition, predation, microhabitat selection and post-settlement movement) in a continuous habitat site and the isolated habitat site are different.

AB The interactions between plants of different species, age or size play an important role in the dynamics of an ecosystem and can induce specific structures. These interactions can be studied by analysing the spatial structure of the corresponding bivariate patterns. The intertype L-12-function has recently been successfully used in many papers for that purpose. However, when interpreting the results obtained with ecological data, at least two different null hypotheses - independence or random labelling - can be appropriate, depending on the context of the study and the nature of the data. As these two hypotheses correspond to different confidence intervals, an inappropriate choice of the null hypothesis can lead to misinterpretations of biotic interactions when studying ecological data. This problem has rarely been mentioned in the literature.
   In this paper we clarify the differences between these two null hypotheses, and illustrate the risk of misinterpretation when using an inappropriate null hypothesis. We review the main characteristics of these two hypotheses, and analyse the spatial structure of both real data from forest stands and simulated virtual stands of different structures. We demonstrate that the risk of misinterpretation is quite high, and that extreme misinterpretations, i.e. cases leading to opposite conclusions in terms of spatial interaction, can occur in a significant number of cases. We therefore propose some guidelines to help ecologists avoid such misinterpretations.

AB The flora of the deciduous forests at the base of the north Estonian limestone escarpment is species rich, with an exceptionally high number of rare bryophyte species. Relationships between species richness of bryophyte and herb layers and biotic and environmental conditions were studied, using General Linear Mixed Models. Human disturbance (waste deposit, tree damage etc) was significantly negatively correlated with species richness of both plant layers. Soil nitrogen content was negatively and soil water retention positively correlated with bryophyte species richness, while herb richness was unrelated to soil factors. After eliminating the effects of environment, negative correlations in species richness and cover between the bryophyte and herb layers were discovered on finer scales (1 m(2)), referring to biotic interactions. This relationship was obscured with the simple correlation analysis. On the other hand, the positive correlation in species pools between the bryophyte and herb layers (0.1 ha) was insignificant. The species pools of both bryophyte and herb layers were significantly positively correlated with the species richness of the tree layer. In summary, bryophyte and herb layer richness responded differently to environmental conditions, but human disturbance significantly decreased the richness of both layers. Due to the uniqueness and small area of these forests we recommend protection and restoration of disturbed sites.

AB The tendency for island populations to differ in body size from their mainland relatives has been well documented, but the mechanisms for these size changes remain speculative. Explanations have typically been based on ecological interactions that directly favor either an increase or decrease in body size. While it is clear that direct ecological interactions can influence body size, life history shifts present an alternative explanation for observed insular size trends across phylogenetic groups and trophic levels. Here I describe how decreased resource availability and reduced predation pressure, the same selective forces invoked by previous hypotheses, can operate to produce body size changes via the evolution of life history traits. This mechanism is more generally applicable than previous explanations and is consistent with much of the available data.

TI On the quality of soil biodiversity indicators: abiotic and biotic
   parameters as predictors of soil faunal richness at different spatial
   scales

AB Direct measurement of soil biodiversity is expensive, and therefore a substitution of measurement by indication is desirable. We analysed three large datasets for the potential to predict the diversity of soil faunal groups from other parameters. The datasets represent different spatial scales, namely grassland nematodes on an European scale, forest collembola on a regional scale, and grassland ants on a local scale. We tested two groups of parameters as possible surrogates for species richness: (1) environmental parameters, such as climate, soil and vegetation characteristics, and (2) community parameters, such as higher taxon richness, indicator taxa, and maximum dominance.
   Climate and soil parameters were significantly correlated with biodiversity in all datasets. However, in spite of the large variety of measurement types analysed, prediction quality of environmental variables was weak and the explained proportion of variance ranged generally below 50%. Richness was subject to considerable stochastic variation among subsamples (CV = 20-60%) thereby evading a narrow correlation with environmental parameters. Higher taxon richness, based on taxa of intermediate hierarchical order, proved the best predictor of richness in collembola and nematodes explaining 55 and 89% of total variance, respectively. A combination of two ant species was the best predictor of ant richness explaining 59% of total variance.
   The authors conclude that a rough guess of soil faunal diversity can be cost-effectively derived from environmental data while an estimate of moderate quality can be obtained with reduced taxonomic effort. The precise richness of a soil community, however, is subject to autogeneous community dynamics, to biotic interactions with other populations, and to conditions in the past, and can therefore only be retrieved by immediate investigation of the community itself. Criteria for the quality of indicator parameters are discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Invasion biology suffers from a lack of the ability to predict the outcome of particular invasions because of reliance on verbal models and lack of rigorous experimental data at the appropriate scale. More progress is likely to be made by considering invasions as population-level phenomena and initially focusing on specific taxa or particular categories of invasions. To this end, we propose a simple conceptual framework to motivate studies of invasion by salmonids (salmon, trout, grayling, and whitefish) in streams that emphasizes population-level mechanisms affecting native species and promoting spread by the invader. Specifically, the only direct mechanisms by which the abundance of the native species can decline are through biotic interactions which cause decreased reproductive rates or survival at specific life stages, net emigration, debilitating or fatal diseases introduced by the invader, or a combination of these factors. Conversely, abundance of the invader must increase by local reproduction, high survival, net immigration, or a combination of these factors. Review of existing salmonid invasion literature suggests that future studies could be improved by using manipulative field experiments at a spatial and temporal scale appropriate to address population-level processes, characterizing how movement affects the establishment and spread of an invader, and including abiotic context in experimental designs. Using the example of brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) invasion into streams containing native Colorado River cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki pleuriticus) in the central Rocky Mountains (USA), we demonstrate how the framework can be used to design a manipulative field experiment to test for population-level mechanisms causing ecological effects and promoting invasion success. Experiments of this type will give invasion ecologists a useful example of how a taxon-specific invasion framework can improve the ability to predict ecological effects, and provide fishery biologists with the quantitative foundation necessary to better manage stream salmonid invasions.

AB Habitat fragmentation and the widespread creation of habitat edges have recently stimulated interest in assessing the effects of ecotones on biodiversity. Ecotones, natural or anthropogenic, can greatly affect faunal movement, population dynamics, species interactions, and community structure. Few data exist, however, on insect community response to forest-savanna ecotones, a natural analog to anthropogenically cleared areas adjacent to forest. In this study, the abundance, total biomass, average individual biomass, and distribution of scarabaeine dung beetles were examined at a sharp tropical evergreen forest-savanna ecotone in Santa Cruz, Bolivia. The abundance, total biomass, and average individual biomass of dung beetles varied significantly across the forest, edge, and savanna habitats. Species richness (S(obs)) also varied significantly across the three habitats, but statistical estimations of true species richness (S(est)) did not. Habitat specificity of the dung beetles in this study was extremely high. Of the 50 most common species collected during the study, only 2 species were collected in both the forest and savanna habitats, signaling nearly complete community turnover in just a few meters. Strong edge effects were evidenced by the decline in abundance, total biomass, and species richness at the forest-savanna boundary.

AB We surveyed 104 potential amphibian-breeding sites in northwest Indiana for the presence and abundance of amphibians, habitat parameters, and water chemistry. Linear regression was used as an exploratory analysis, and stepwise multiple regression and ANOVA were used to model factors that best explained amphibian species richness, abundance, and number of years with breeding populations. The most important breeding site factors among those studied were wetlands with semi-permanent hydrology, levels of dissolved chloride, silica, hardness and alkalinity, standing waters that were not ditches, wetlands without agriculture within 200 m, the number of hydrology types within one kilometer, the number of wetlands within 400 m, and biotic interactions within the amphibian community. Minor factors included the presence of ammonia, turbidity, low phosphates, low detergents and pH level; wetlands with wooded upland habitats <200 m, palustrine wetland habitats, surface area of the wetland, and percentage of the wetland covered by emergent vegetation.

AB Legumes, with the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen (N), may help alleviate the N limitations thought to constrain plant community response to elevated concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). To address this issue we assessed: (1) the effects of the presence of the perennial grassland N-2 fixer, Lupinus perennis, on biomass accumulation and plant N concentrations of nine-species plots of differing plant composition; (2) leaf-level physiology of co-occurring non-fixing species (Achillea millefolium, Agropyron repens, Koeleria cristata) in these assemblages with and without Lupinus; (3) the effects of elevated CO2 on Lupinus growth and symbiotic N-2 fixation in both monoculture and the nine-species assemblages; and (4) whether assemblages containing Lupinus exhibit larger physiological and growth responses to elevated CO2 than those without. This study was part of a long-term grassland field experiment (BioCON) that controls atmospheric CO2 at current ambient and elevated (560 mumol mol(-1)) concentrations using free-air CO2 enrichment. Nine-species plots with Lupinus had 32% higher whole plot plant N concentrations and 26% higher total plant N pools than those without Lupinus, based on both above and belowground measurements. Co-occurring non-fixer leaf N concentrations increased 22% and mass-based net photosynthetic rates increased 41% in plots containing Lupinus compared to those without. With CO2 enrichment, Lupinus monocultures accumulated 32% more biomass and increased the proportion of N derived from fixation from 44% to 57%. In nine-species assemblages, Lupinus N derived from fixation increased similarly from 43% to 54%. Although Lupinus presence enhanced photosynthetic rates and leaf N concentrations of co-occurring non-fixers, and increased overall plant N pools, Lupinus presence did not facilitate stronger photosynthetic responses of non-fixing species or larger growth responses of overall plant communities to elevated CO2. Non-fixer leaf N concentrations declined similarly in response to elevated CO2 with and without Lupinus present and the relationship between net photosynthesis and leaf N was not affected by Lupinus presence. Regardless of the presence or absence of Lupinus, CO2 enrichment resulted in reduced leaf N concentrations and rates of net photosynthesis.

AB Long-distance dispersal (LDD)-dispersal beyond the bounds of the local patch or cluster of conspecifics-will be most advantageous in landscapes in which large areas of suitable habitat are consistently available at long distances from established populations. We review conditions under which LDD will be selected and conclude that biotic interactions, and in particular specialized natural enemies, are likely to be one of the most important factors selecting for LDD in many species. We use simple spatially implicit and spatially explicit models to illustrate how such pests affect the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) for investment in LDD. Patches currently occupied by parents are more likely to be infected than distant, potentially unoccupied,. patches, thus advantaging dispersal. Patchy infestations also result in higher variance in reproductive success among patches, which alone selects for increased among-patch dispersal. Both of these effects increase with the strength of the impact of infestation, and with the number of species competing for space in the community. We discuss the potential of different types of models and analytical tools to capture the impacts of pests on the evolution of LDD, and conclude that even simple models can illustrate the general relationship between pest pressure and LDD advantage, but only spatially explicit simulation models can fully elucidate the resulting ecological and evolutionary dynamics. In conclusion, we consider the potential role of selection for LDD in the spread of invasive species, and in long-term responses to habitat fragmentation and range shifts.

AB Many organisms living in heterogeneous environments alter behaviors or morphology when developing in the presence of predators and subsequently incur associated sublethal fitness costs. Larvae of the mayfly Callibaetis ferrugineus hageni develop in beaver ponds with or without trout predators. We examined the potential sublethal fitness costs of developing in the presence of trout predators by comparing patterns of timing and size at emergence from ponds over two years, before and after manipulating trout densities. In addition, the behavior, timing, and size at emergence of larvae reared in mesocosms were compared between treatments with and without trout chemical cues. Timing of mayfly emergence and adult size was not affected by the manipulation of trout in the field, or by the presence of trout chemical cues in mesocosms. Observations of mayflies in mesocosms provided no evidence that predator cues induced antipredator behaviors, such as reduced activity or increased crypsis. Surprisingly, late instar larvae swam more frequently in the presence of trout cues during the middle of the day, a behavior that could increase their vulnerability to visually feeding predators. Thus, larvae did not exhibit any traits expected to increase survival in the presence of trout cues. The apparently maladaptive responses to trout may result from phylogenetic inertia or conflicting selection pressures encountered when developing in fishless habitats. The evolution of plasticity to trout in Callibaetis may be inhibited by frequent dispersal from fishless source populations.

AB 1. Changes in species' abundance and distributions caused by human disturbances can have indirect effects on other species in a community. Although ecosystem approaches to management are becoming increasingly prevalent, they require a fuller understanding of how individual behaviour determines interactions within and between species.
   2. Ecological interactions involving krill are of major importance to many species within the Antarctic. Despite extensive knowledge of the ecosystem that they occupy, there is still incomplete understanding of the links between species and the effect of environmental conditions on these interactions. In this study, we extended a behavioural model used previously to understand the interactions between penguins and krill to determine the indirect effect of krill fisheries on penguin foraging success and behaviour in adjacent breeding sites.
   3. Increased fishing pressure offshore is predicted to reduce penguin food intake. Given the documented links between krill and penguins, this also leads to a prediction of decreased penguin survival and reproduction. Krill behaviour is predicted to cause stronger effects of krill fisheries than explained solely by the percentage of biomass removed. Environmental conditions that decrease krill growth rates or cause krill to spend time in deeper water are also predicted to increase the magnitude of the effect of fishing on penguin success. We show that changes in penguin foraging behaviour can be used to assess the impact of local fisheries on penguin reproductive success.
   4. Synthesis and applications. These results demonstrate that an understanding of predator-prey interactions, indirect effects between species, and individual behaviour is imperative to our ability to manage populations. We describe a general method to use what is known about ecological and evolutionary processes with species-specific information to predict the response of organisms to novel situations. We further show how individual behaviour can be used to assess the impact of human disturbance on ecosystems.

AB 1 Fragmentation reduces size and increases isolation of plant habitats, and increases the ratio between edge and centre area. Consequences of habitat fragmentation have rarely been studied for common plants, and edge effects are rarely studied for plants in general. We studied density, population structure, fitness components and biotic interactions in the locally abundant distylous fen plant Primula farinosa in the centres and at the edges of 27 Swiss fen habitats of different size and degree of isolation.
   2 Population sizes ranged from 80 to 106 450 flowering plants and were larger in larger fen habitats than in smaller ones.
   3 The densities of plants were lower in more isolated habitats (by 26-46% depending on developmental stage). In the less isolated habitats, the density of seedlings and juveniles was higher in larger habitats. Plant densities were lower at the edge than in the centre of habitats (34-55%), and edges had fewer plants of younger developmental states. Densities of reproductive plants differed only in the centres of habitats, where they were higher in larger habitats, while at the edges these densities were independent of habitat area.
   4 Flower morph proportions were independent of size and isolation of habitats.
   5 Plants in larger habitats had larger rosette diameters and tended to have more flowers.
   6 At edges, seed set was on average 11% lower, and occurrence and degree of herbivory more than 50% higher, than in centres. Capsule frugivory was less likely in larger habitats. Infection by the smut fungus Urocystis primulicola was more likely in larger habitats.
   7 We conclude that size, isolation and edge to centre ratio of fen habitats all affect the abundant P. farinosa and recommend that edge effects and more common species are given more attention.

AB Phoretic mites of bark beetles are classic examples of commensal ectosymbionts. However, many such mites appear to have mutualisms with fungi that could themselves interact with beetles. We tested for indirect effects of phoretic mites on Dendroctonus frontalis, which attacks and kills pine trees in North America. Tarsonemus mites are known to carry ascospores of Ophiostoma minus, which tends to outcompete the mutualistic fungi carried by D. frontalis. Experimental additions and removals of mites from beetles demonstrated that Tarsonemus propagate O. minus in beetle oviposition galleries. Furthermore, the abundance of Tarsonemus and O. minus tended to covary in nature. These results verified a strong mutualism between Torsonemus and O. minus. Results also indicated that O. minus is an antagonist of D. frontalis: beetle larvae seldom survived in the presence of O. minus (compared to 83%, survival elsewhere). Apparently, this is an indirect result of O. minus outcompeting the two species of mycangial fungi that are critical to beetle nutrition. Thus, Tarsonemus mites close a loop of species interactions that includes a commensalism (mites and beetles), a mutualism (mites and O. minus), asymmetric competition (O. minus and mycangial fungi), and another mutualism (mycangial fungi and beetles). This interaction system produces negative feedback that could contribute to the endogenous population dynamics of D. frontalis. Reproductive rate of Tarsonemus was more temperature-sensitive than beetle generation time (which constrains the time for mite reproduction within a tree). This differential temperature sensitivity produces a narrow range of temperatures (centred at 27degreesC) in which mite reproduction per D. frontalis generation can attain its maximum of 100 mites/beetle. Consequently, seasonal oscillations in temperature are predicted to produce oscillations in the D. frontalis community, and climatic differences between regions could influence the community to dampen or exacerbate the cyclical outbreak dynamics of D. frontalis.

AB There is growing evidence that interactions among plants can be facilitative as well as competitive, but knowledge of how disturbances influence these interactions and how they vary with species diversity is lacking. We manipulated plant density, species diversity (richness), and a burial disturbance in a controlled, complete factorial experiment to test theories about the relationships among species interactions, disturbance, and richness. The hypotheses tested were 1) burial disturbance reduces plant performance at all levels of density and richness, 2) burial disturbance can cause net plant interactions to become more facilitative, and 3) facilitation increases with species richness. Burial decreased plant survival by 60% and biomass by 50%, supporting the hypothesis that burial reduces plant performance. In the control (unburied) treatment, there was no difference in proportion survival or per plant biomass between low and high density plots, meaning that neither competition nor facilitation was detected. In the buried treatment, however, high density plots had significantly greater survival and greater per plant biomass than the low density plots, indicating net facilitative interactions. Thus facilitation occurred in the buried treatment and not in the unburied control plots, supporting the hypothesis that facilitation increases with increasing disturbance severity. The hypothesis that facilitation increases with increasing species richness was not supported. Richness did not affect survival or biomass, and there was no richness by burial treatment interaction, indicating that richness did not influence the response of the community to burial. The influence of the disturbance on plant interactions was thus consistent across levels of richness, increasing the generality of the relationship between disturbance and facilitation.

AB This work presents a dynamic model to predict phytoplankton biomass and production. The model has been developed as an integral part within the framework of a more comprehensive lake ecosystem model, LakeWeb, which also accounts for production and biomass of bacterioplankton, two types of zooplankton (herbivorous and predatory), two types of fish (prey and predatory), as well as zoobenthos, macrophytes and benthic algae. The LakeWeb-model is based on ordinary differential equations (the ecosystem perspective) and gives seasonal variations (the calculation time, dt, is 1 week and Euler's integration method has been applied). The sub-model for phytoplankton presented in this work is meant to account for all fundamental abiotic/biotic interactions and feedbacks (including predation by herbivorous zooplankton) for lakes in general. The model has not been tested in the traditional way using data from a few well investigated lakes. Instead, it has been tested using empirical regressions based on data from many lakes. The basic aim of this dynamic model is that it should capture typical functional and structural patterns in many lakes. It accounts for how variations in (1) lake phosphorus concentrations, (2) water clarity, (3) lake morphometry, (4) water temperature, (5) lake pH and (6) predation by herbivorous zooplankton influence production and biomass of phytoplankton. An important demand for this model is that it should be driven by variables easily accessed from standard monitoring programs and maps (the driving variables are: total phosphorus, colour, pH, lake mean depth, lake area, and epilimnetic temperatures). We have demonstrated that the new model gives predictions that agree well with the values given by the empirical regressions, and also expected and requested divergences from these regression lines when they do not provide sufficient resolution. The model has been tested in a very wide limnological domain: TP values from 3 to 300 mug/l, which covers ultraoligotrophic to hypertrophic conditions, colour values from 3 to 300 mg Pt/l, which covers ultraoligohumic to highly dystrophic conditions, pH from 3 to 11, which covers the entire natural range, and lake areas from 0.1 to 100 km(2).

AB Competition for shared resources is typically invoked as the most important ecological interaction promoting diversification and speciation, whereas the roles of abiotic variables and natural enemies have been largely neglected. To improve our understanding of the ecological factors involved in the evolution of sympatric stickleback species pairs (Gasterosteus aculeatus), I examined whether lakes in the same region with only a solitary population of sticklebacks had unique features not shared with lakes containing stickleback species pairs. Sixteen lakes with a solitary population of sticklebacks were identified as potential candidates for two invasions of marine ancestors. Several physical and chemical characteristics of these candidate lakes were found to be not significantly different from those of lakes with sympatric species pairs. However, when the community of other fish species was considered, a striking pattern emerged: all but one of the 16 candidate lakes contained other fish species in addition to cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki), whereas sympatric species pairs were found only in lakes with cutthroat trout and no other fish species. The two other fish species most often encountered, prickly sculpin (Cottus asper) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), are potential competitors and predators of threespine sticklebacks. The results of this survey suggest that our understanding of the role of ecology in diversification and speciation will be furthered by a consideration of interactions other than interspecific competition between focal populations.

AB Bacteriocins are the most abundant and diverse defense systems in bacteria. As a result of the specific mechanisms of bacteriocin recognition and translocation into the target cell it is assumed that these toxins mediate intra-specific or population-level interactions. However, no published studies specifically address this question. We present here a survey of bacteriocin production in a collection of enteric bacteria isolated from wild mammals in Australia. A subset of the bacteriocin-producing strains was assayed for the ability to kill a broad range of enteric bacteria from the same bacterial collection. A novel method of estimating killing breadth was developed and used to compare the surveyed bacteriocins in terms of the phylogenetic range over which they kill. The most striking result is that although bacteriocin-producers kill members of their own species most frequently, some kill phylogenetically distant taxa more frequently than they kill closer relatives. This study calls into question the role these toxins play in natural populations. A significant number of bacteriocins are highly effective in killing inter-specific strains and thus bacteriocins may serve to mediate bacterial community interactions.

AB To link spatial patterns and ecological processes, we analysed the distribution of two shrub species (one large and dominant, the other smaller) and estimated the reproductive consequences of their distribution for the smaller species. We tested the significance of the spatial distribution pattern of the two shrubs by second-order bivariate point pattern analysis (Ripley's K function). Performance of Asparagus albus, the smaller shrub, was measured as (1) survival of transplanted seedlings in two contrasting habitats: patches of the dominant shrub (Ziziphus lotus), and open interspaces; and (2) reproductive output of plants naturally occurring in both habitats. The two species were significantly aggregated. Transplanted Asparagus albus seedlings had higher survival rates in patches than in the open. Plants produced more flowers, fruits, and showed a higher mass of seeds when living in aggregates than when isolated. The mechanisms responsible for this facilitative effect seem to be related to soil enrichment in patches. These results suggest that the spatial aggregation of species can be indicative of a positive interaction among them, directly affecting fitness of at least one of the species. Facilitation, by inducing variations in the reproductive performance may play a major role in the demography and dynamics of plant populations.

AB Preferential association with familiar shoal mates confers a number of potentially important benefits to individuals, including improved anti-predator effects and the reduction of aggression in competitive interactions. Until now, however, familiarity has been demonstrated purely between conspecifics. Here, we present evidence that familiarity preferences can override natural preferences for conspecifics. Individual focal fishes (chub, Leuciscus cephalus) were given a choice of two stimulus shoals of the same size composed of conspecifics or of heterospecifics (minnows, Phoxinus phoxinus) in a flow tank. A series of four treatments was carried out to investigate the effects of familiarity, induced by a 15 day association between the focal fish and the stimulus fishes, on the choices made by the focal fish. Focal fishes showed a significant preference for conspecifics over heterospecifics when both stimulus shoals were composed of nonfamiliar individuals. Focal fishes also showed a significant preference for stimulus shoals composed of familiar fishes over stimulus shoals composed of non-familiar fishes when both shoals were conspecific and when both shoals were heterospecific. Finally, the preference of focal fishes for conspecifics disappeared when the alternative, a shoal of heterospecifics, was composed of familiar individuals. The importance of this work is discussed in the context of species interactions in free-ranging shoals.

AB Local interactions, biotic and abiotic, can have a strong influence on the large-scale properties of ecosystems. However, ecological models often explore the influence of local biotic interactions where physical disturbance is included as a large-scale and imposed source of variability but is not allowed to interact with biotic processes at the local scale. In marine intertidal communities dominated by mussels, wave disturbances create gaps in the mussel bed that recover through a successional sequence. We present a lattice model of mussel disturbance dynamics that allows local interactions between wave disturbance and mussel recolonization, in which each cell of the lattice can be empty, occupied by a mussel bed element, or disturbed (which corresponds to a newly disturbed cell that has unstable edges). As in natural ecosystems, wave disturbance can also spread from disturbed to adjacent occupied cells, and recolonization can also spread from occupied to adjacent empty cells. We first validate the local rules from artificial gap experiments and from natural gap monitoring along the Oregon coast. We analyze the properties of the model system as a function of different oceanographic forcings of productivity and disturbance. We show that the mussel bed can go through phase transitions characterized by a large sensitivity of mussel cover and patterns to oceanographic forcings but also that criticality (scale invariance) is observed over wide ranges of parameters, which suggests self-organization. We also show that spatial patterns in the intertidal can provide a robust signature of local processes and can inform about oceanographic regimes. We do so by comparing the large-scale patterns of the simulation (scaling exponents) with field data, which suggest that some experimental sites are close to criticality. Our results suggest that regional patterns in disturbed populations can be explained by local biotic and abiotic processes submitted to oceanographic forcing.

AB The effects of warming on a montane meadow was simulated by a translocation experiment. A coherent piece of turf and soil was transferred from 600 m to 170 m a.s.l., corresponding to an increase in temperature of ca. 2.8 K. The vegetation was monitored by recording cover and counting individuals one year before the translocation and continued for the subsequent seven years. For comparison, a control plot that had also been translocated but remained at 600 m was monitored. Four of eight species with a montane distribution in Europe showed a constant degree of cover during the investigation period (Nardus stricta, Poa chaixii, Polygonatum verticillatum, Potentilla erecta). In contrast, another four montane species declined in cover or died out (Arnica montana, Meum athamanticum, Hypericum maculatum, Galium harcynicum). None of these species declined on the control plot. It is argued that the species' responded individualistically to the site factors that had changed with the translocation to low altitude. A direct effect of enhanced temperature was probably the reason for the decline of only one species (Meum athamanticum). Reduced humidity might be the reason for the extinction of two moisture demanding species (Viola palustris, Succisa pratensis). The biomass of the plot increased by increased growth of one of the matrix species (Festuca rubra), probably due to elevated nutrient mineralization. Many low growing species responded indirectly to the reduced light availability; caused by an increased level of competition for light (e.g. Galium harcynicum). Increased slug herbivory at low altitude resulted in the extinction of Arnica montana. At the end of the investigation period, the similarity in species composition to the initial state was only 45%, indicating that the community had changed into a different plant association. The importance of considering biotic interactions when predicting the impacts of climate change is discussed.

AB The effects of local habitat and large-scale landscape factors on species diversity and species interactions were studied using the insect community in stems of the creeping thistle Cirsium arvense. Thistle abundance was higher in fallows than in crop fields and field margins, with fallows providing 67% of thistle abundance within 15 study areas on a landscape scale. Species richness of the herbivores was positively related with thistle abundance, parasitoid species richness was influenced by habitat type and was positively correlated with herbivore species richness. The abundance of herbivores and parasitoids was affected by local factors such as habitat type and host abundance, but also by landscape factors such as the percentage of non-crop area and the isolation of habitats. The infestation rate caused by the agromyzid Melanagromyza aeneoventris was positively related to percent non-crop area, whereas the parasitism rate of this fly increased with increasing habitat diversity on the landscape scale. For these two interactions and for total herbivore abundance, a scale-dependency of the landscape effects was found. The results emphasize that biological diversity and ecological functions within a plant-insect community are not only affected by local habitat factors but also by large-scale landscape characteristics. Hence, to improve future agri-environmental schemes for biodiversity conservation and biological control large-scale landscape effects and their scale-dependency should be considered.

AB The distribution and abundance of organisms are affected by behaviors, such as habitat selection, foraging, and reproduction. These behaviors are driven by interactions within and between species, environmental conditions, and the biology of the species involved. Although extensive theoretical work has explored predator-prey dynamics, these models have not considered the impact of behavioral plasticity and life-history trade-offs on predicted patterns. We apply a modeling method that allows the consideration of a spatial, dynamic ecological game between predators and prey using a life-history perspective. As an illustrative example, we model the habitat selection of Antarctic krill- and penguins during the time when penguins are land-based for reproduction. Although environmental conditions and the life-history constraints of each species have both direct and indirect effects on both species, the penguin's foraging rule (whether food-maximizing or time-minimizing) has the greatest effect on the qualitative distribution pattern of both species. Size-dependent-diel vertical migration of krill also strongly affects penguin foraging patterns. This model generates suggestions for future research and qualitative predictions that can be tested in the field. The application of this method to a specific problem also demonstrates its ability to increase our understanding of important ecological interactions in general.

AB The effects of multiple predators on their prey are frequently non-additive because of interactions among predators. When prey shift habitats through ontogeny, many of their predators cannot interact directly. However, predators that occur in different habitats or feed on different prey stages may still interact through indirect effects mediated by prey traits and density. We conducted an experiment to evaluate the combined effects of arboreal egg-stage and aquatic larval-stage predators of the African treefrog, Hyperolius spinigularis . Egg and larval predator effects were non-additive - more Hyperolius survived both predators than predicted from their independent effects. Egg-stage predator effects on aquatic larval density and size and age at hatching reduced the effectiveness of larval-stage predators by 70%. Our results indicate that density- and trait-mediated indirect interactions can act across life-stages and habitats, resulting in non-additive multi-predator effects.

AB Loss of species caused by widespread stressors, such as drought and fragmentation, is likely to be non-random depending on species abundance in the community. We experimentally reduced the number of rare and uncommon plant species while independently reducing only the abundance of dominant grass species in intact, native grassland. This allowed us to simulate a non-random pattern of species loss, based on species abundances, from communities shaped by natural ecological interactions and characterized by uneven species abundance distributions. Over two growing seasons, total above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) declined with reductions in abundance of the dominant species but was unaffected by a threefold decline in richness of less common species. In contrast, productivity of the remaining rare and uncommon species decreased with declining richness, in part due to loss of complementary interactions among these species. However, increased production of the dominant grasses offset the negative effects of species loss. We conclude that the dominant species, as controllers of ecosystem function, can provide short-term resistance to reductions in ecosystem function when species loss is nonrandom. However, the concurrent loss of complementary interactions among rare and uncommon species, the most diverse component of communities, may contribute to additional species loss and portends erosion of ecosystem function in the long term.

AB Parasites can alter the behavior, life history, and morphology of their host. Many trematodes parasitize freshwater pulmonate snails, resulting in a reduction or the elimination of reproduction in those individuals. However, parasite effects on freshwater snail behavior are unclear. I measured trematode infection rates, size, and covered habitat use of the freshwater pulmonate snail Physa integra in a field survey of streams and ponds on Konza Prairie Biological Station. Then, in a laboratory experiment, I tested the hypothesis that behavioral decisions under the risk of predation differed between infected and uninfected R integra. Infection rates ranged from 2%, to 53% overall, but varied between snail size class and site of collection. Significantly fewer infected (7%) than uninfected P integra (29%) were found under cover, but there was no difference in use of cover between snails infected with Paramphistomidae and Cathaemasiidae trematodes. A significantly greater proportion of larger snail size classes were infected than smaller size classes. In the laboratory experiment, habitat use by P integra depended on predator presence and infection status. Significantly more uninfected snails used covered habitats in the presence of creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus) than in the presence of crayfish (Orconectes nais) or in the absence of a predator. Significantly more uninfected snails used near-surface habitat in the presence of O. nais than in other treatments. However, in the presence of S. atromaculatus <20% of infected snails used cover compared to 60% of uninfected snails. Near-surface habitat use and crawlout behavior were also significantly higher among infected snails in crayfish and no predator treatments, suggesting that infected snails use near-surface habitats even when under predation risk. More detailed knowledge of this trematode-snail system is necessary however, to determine if differences in habitat use between infected and uninfected snails is an adaptive manipulation of snail behavior by trematodes. Nevertheless, these results indicate that infection status affects the behavior of P integra and may alter species interactions in freshwater benthic communities.

AB Life-history traits can play important roles in determining the course of ecological species interactions. We explored the consequences of host age on a host-pathogen interaction by quantifying pathogen frequency in an age-structured host population. Our project was motivated by an interest in whether the demographic structure of a host population has consequences for species interactions. In 2 successive years, we planted large cohorts of the perennial herb Plantago lanceolata in its natural environment and observed infection by Fusarium moniliforme, a non-lethal floral fungal pathogen, over 3 years. We documented substantial variation of pathogen frequency across years and between cohorts. Logistic regression revealed that pathogen frequency increased with the number of inflorescences produced and with evidence of prior pathogen presence, whereas it decreased with increasing plant longevity. In addition, interannual variation and an age-year interaction contributed to the observed pathogen frequencies. There was a significant positive effect of age on pathogen frequency overall, but this was not consistent over all ages. Pathogen frequency was higher in 2-year-old plants than in 1-year-olds, suggesting that age-structure can influence the host-pathogen interaction. This pattern did not continue into 3-year-old plants. A possible explanation for this is that selective mortality allows only generally robust plants, and consequently the most resistant plants, to survive to the oldest ages.

AB Experiments in exclosures were conducted on a salt marsh in a macrotidal system in western France. The aim of this study was threefold: (1) to compare vegetation dynamics over a period of 8 years in grazed and ungrazed conditions (2) to investigate the response of annual species to grazing duration during seedling establishment (3) to test the effect of an increase in soil nitrogen availability after cessation of grazing on interactions between Suaeda maritima and Puccinellia maritima. In grazed conditions, during all the survey, vegetation was dominated by a short R maritima sward with the annual Salicornia europaea in the lower and middle marshes. However, after cessation of grazing in 1994, a homogeneous matrix of the forb Halimione portulacoides, quickly replaced P. maritima in the well drained lower marsh. At the middle marsh level, fine sediment and poor drainage maintained R maritima while the annual S. maritima which tolerates taller and denser vegetation replaced S. europaea. Elymus pungens cover was limited till 2000 but its rising in 2001 let expect its dominance in the future. While P. maritima abundance remained high, spring abundance of annual species such as S. europaea and S. maritima globally decreased with sheep grazing duration on the salt marsh between February and June. Experiments with monocultures of P. maritima and S. maritima demonstrated that nitrogen was a limiting factor on the salt marsh. In a mixed community, a moderate application of nitrogen (15 g N m(-2) year(-1) as NH4-NO3) promoted growth of P. maritima and limited the biomass of S. maritima, but growth of the latter was enhanced by a high application of nitrogen (30 g N m(-2) year(-1)). An increase in the abundance of annuals such as S. maritima on the salt marsh is discussed. (C) 2003 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.

AB The investigation of perturbation experiments is important not only to forecast the effect of human management but also to know community interactions. In the present paper, we study the press perturbation, where the death rate d of a target species is altered and held at higher or lower levels. Lattice Lotka-Volterra model (LLVM) is applied to know response of ecosystem. We also apply the theory of perturbation expansion to both mean-field and pair approximations (PA). Both computer simulation for lattice model and perturbation expansion theory reveal that the density of the target species takes the maximum value at a non-zero value of d. Extreme decrease of death rate leads to its density decrease: avoidance of death in the target species indirectly causes not only decrease of its prey but also increase of predators. An evolutionary meaning of the optimized death rate is discussed. Especially, we describe ecological apoptosis: individuals or organisms have a positive meaning of death.

AB Natural ecological communities are continuously buffeted by a varying environment, often making it difficult to measure the stability of communities using concepts requiring the existence of an equilibrium point. Instead of an equilibrium point, the equilibrial state of communities subject to environmental stochasticity is a stationary distribution, which is characterized by means, variances, and other statistical moments. Here, we derive three properties of stochastic multispecies communities that measure different characteristics associated with community stability. These properties can be estimated from multispecies time-series data using first-order multivariate autoregressive (MAk(1)) models. We demonstrate how to estimate the parameters of MAR(1) models and obtain confidence intervals for both parameters and the measures of stability. We also address the problem of estimation when there is observation (measurement) error. To illustrate these methods, we compare the stability of the planktonic communities in three lakes in which nutrient loading and planktivorous fish abundance were experimentally manipulated. MAR(1) models and the statistical methods we present can be used to identify dynamically important interactions between species and to test hypotheses about stability and other dynamical properties of naturally varying ecological communities. Thus, they can be used to integrate theoretical and empirical studies of community dynamics.

AB The transition to piscivory is a crucial ontogenetic niche shift for many primarily piscivorous fishes. An early transition to piscivory may increase growth, decrease mortality, and therefore enhance lifetime fitness. Although much is known about the extent and causes of variation in the timing of the shift to piscivory among species and among cohorts within a species, little is known about the extent and causes of variation in the timing of the switch to piscivory among individuals within a single cohort. Here, I link otolith age and growth analysis to direct diet and stable isotope analyses to examine variation in the timing of the transition to piscivory and its causes among individual members of the 1994 largemouth bass cohort in Paul Lake, Michigan. Stable isotope and direct diet analyses indicate that only a few members of the 1994 cohort were able to shift to and sustain piscivory in their first summer of life (early piscivores), while most cohort members would have to wait until their second summer of life to become piscivorous (late piscivores).. Significant differences in growth rate between early and late piscivores emerged shortly after 18 June, the first date of possible piscivory by early piscivores, after which early piscivores began to grow at rates nearly twice that of late piscivores. Otolith and stable isotope analyses combined indicate that an early hatching date was necessary, but not sufficient, to explain variation in the timing of the transition to piscivory. All early piscivores were hatched early in the summer, but many early-hatched members of the 1994 cohort did not shift to piscivory in their first summer of life. A combination of at least 10 days of variation in hatching dates and higher-than-average growth rates was required for early piscivores to switch to and sustain piscivory in their first summer of life. Individuals that were able to make the early transition to piscivory most likely benefited from both increased survival and fecundity over much of their life, the combination of which would confer a substantial fitness advantage upon individuals able to make the early transition to piscivory.

AB The dynamical consequences of multiple-species interactions remain an elusive and fiercely debated topic. Recently, Murdoch and colleagues proposed a general rule for the dynamics of generalist natural enemies: when periodic, they exhibit single generation cycles (SGCs), similar to single species systems. This contrasts markedly with specialists, which tend to show classic (longer period) consumer-resource cycles. Using a well-studied laboratory system, we show that this general rule is contradicted when we consider resource age-structure.

AB Macroecology proceeds by identifying patterns and then identifying processes that cause those patterns. Most of the processes that macroecologists study are local in nature and tend to involve species interactions and speciation and extinction processes. In contrast, we propose that several important macroecological patterns can be explained by very large-scale processes that are primarily spatial in nature. Specifically, we suggest that the structure of abundance across a species' entire range combined with interspecific patterns in range location and global abundance can explain the well-known macroecological patterns of: (1) a positive correlation between range size and abundance, (2) the species-area relationship, (3) decay of species similarity with distance and (4) the species abundance distribution. We show that spatial processes produce these patterns through a combination of analytical and Monte Carlo analysis. We also show that the connection is robust (indifferent) to the precise mathematical assumptions. Such a theory might be called a unified theory, because it explains multiple patterns with a few processes. To differentiate among the growing number of unified theories, we suggest that testing additional predictions over and above producing curves of the correct shape is important. To this end, we present several novel, quantitative predictions and provide empirical tests. In short, we provide an empirically grounded and tested theory, which suggests that superimposing individual species ranges across space creates local community patterns.

AB 1. A new mass-balance model was developed to predict phosphorus fluxes to, within and from lakes and lake concentrations of phosphorus.
   2. The model is driven by data easily accessed from standard monitoring programmes or maps, so it should be useful in many contexts of lake management.
   3. The phosphorus model gives seasonal (weekly) variations and accounts for all fundamental abiotic/biotic interactions and feedbacks for lakes in general for phosphorus. The model has been developed within the framework of a more comprehensive ecosystem model, LakeWeb, which accounts for production values and biomasses of nine functional groups of organisms (phytoplankton, bacterioplankton, herbivorous and predatory zooplankton, prey and predatory fish, zoobenthos, macrophytes and benthic algae).
   4. The LakeWeb-model has been critically tested in a wide limnological domain and shown to predict very well. By using this model, it is possible for the first time to predict realistic values of biouptake and retention of phosphorous in biota in lakes on a weekly basis.

AB Molecular markers often offer the only means to discriminate between species and to elucidate the specificity of many community interactions, both of which are key to the understanding of ecological patterns. Western Atlantic populations of the bryozoan Bugula neritina vary in the palatability of their larvae to predators: individuals south of Cape Hatteras produce chemical deterrents to fish predators that are absent in more northern individuals. We use mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase c subunit I (COI) sequences to show that the differences in palatability between populations correlate with the geographical distributions of two cryptic species within B. neritina . Furthermore, these cryptic species differ in their associations with bacteria that may confer chemical resistance to predation. Small subunit rRNA primers specific to a subset of gamma-proteobacteria amplified only the bacterium Endobugula sertula from the southern cryptic species. Endobugula sertula produces a family of chemical compounds (bryostatins) that may deter predators of its animal host. In contrast, the same primers amplified an array of gamma-proteobacteria from the unprotected northern cryptic bryozoan species, but never E. sertula . In combination, these findings suggest that the geographical variation in palatability observed in the larvae of B. neritina is not the result of local adaptation of a single species to regions of differing predation pressure, but rather results from the comparison of cryptic species that differ in the presence or absence of a bacterium that may provide protection against predators. The ability to identify the cryptic Bugula species and their differing relationships with bacterial associates provides an example of the important role molecular techniques may play in addressing ecological questions.

AB Tadpoles and mosquito larvae often co-occur, and may compete for scarce resources. However, competition between such distantly related organisms has attracted less scientific attention than have interactions among closely related taxa. We examined ecological interactions in two tadpole-mosquito systems in southeastern Australia, one from freshwater ponds (Limnodynastes peronii and Culex quinquefasciatus) and one from brackish-water habitats (Crinia signifera and Ochlerotatus australis). Diets of these tadpoles and mosquito larvae overlap considerably, potentially leading to competition for food. Laboratory experiments show that, in both study systems, mosquitoes reduced the growth rates of tadpoles, and tadpoles reduced the growth rates and survival of mosquito larvae. These negative effects were seen even at high food levels. Thus, our study suggests that tadpoles and mosquito larvae affect each other strongly, and do so via pathways other than simple consumptive competition. Because mosquitoes are important vectors for human diseases, the global decline in amphibian populations may have more impact on human health than has generally been anticipated.

AB A confirmatory structural equation model was built in order to test the generality of Grace and Pugesek's model of species richness. A main feature of their model was that light reaching the soil surface had the strongest effects on species richness, and that disturbance and biomass effects were largely indirect via effects on light. Their model was not confirmed for the understory vegetation of floodplain oak savannas and a new model had numerous fundamental differences. Disturbance history had the strongest direct effects on richness and these were independent of biomass effects. Richness was maximal at intermediate disturbance and biomass. Bivariate relationships between soil quality and species density were very weak because soil quality simultaneously had negative direct effects and positive indirect effects (through biomass), such that the total effect of soil was negligible. This provides an example of how structural modeling can provide insights that are not possible with other numerical methods. The complex effects of soils support recent findings that some soil components tend to increase richness via a species pool effect while other components tend to reduce richness via biotic interactions. The effects of light were not significant, but canopy trees had weak, positive effects, and this contradicts other structural models which have generally shown that shading reduces species richness. Here, species richness increases with shade presumably because of species pool effects, whereby the species pool increases by including prairie, savanna, and some woodland species and indirectly by reducing dominance by warm-season grasses. The results have implications for management because of the overall importance of disturbance history, however the majority of the variation in richness was left unexplained and this suggests other factors such as dispersal limitation, soil fungi, and historical effects may be of overriding importance in these oak savannas.

AB Increasing dominance of grass species such as Deschampsia flexuosa on lowland dry heathlands is a major problem for land managers. This problem is especially acute in north-west Europe where replacement of dwarf-shrubs by grasses has been linked to high levels of nitrogen deposition. Interactions between Calluna vulgaris and D. flexuosa were examined using pot experiments under a variety of watering (drought vs. no drought), nitrogen addition (10 vs. 50 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) and soil type (peaty vs. sandy) regimes. Two experiments using identical replacement series designs were used to investigate interactions between these two species at the seedling and young plant stage. Response of the two species to the environmental variables was different for seedlings and young plants. In the seedling experiment D. flexuosa responded significantly to soil type only, with greater cover on peaty soil than on sandy soil after 6 months. C. vulgaris germination showed a significant response to watering regime, with fewer seedlings in plots that had a drought treatment imposed. When the experiment was repeated using young plants of C. vulgaris and D. flexuosa both species responded significantly to soil type only. Height, % cover and shoot biomass of both species were greater when grown in peaty soil than when grown in sandy soil. Watering and nitrogen addition had few significant effects. Species interactions were mainly one-way. C. vulgaris biomass yield was reduced when grown in mixture with D. flexuosa, whilst D. flexuosa yield was unaffected by the presence of C. vulgaris. The yield density curve for D. flexuosa indicated that intra-specific competition was occurring at planting densities above 29 plants m(-2) whilst this was not seen for C. vulgaris. The effect of soil type on species interactions was also investigated. C. vulgaris was best able to compete with D. flexuosa on sandy soils where the shoot biomass ratio was greatest (C. vulgaris: D. flexuosa = 1:4.4). Differences in the responses of these species to the environmental variables investigated may help to explain heathland vegetation changes seen under field conditions.

AB Within the framework of the Italian XVII PNRA expedition (austral summer 2001-2002), six specimens of the demosponge Haliclona dancoi (Topsent 1901) were collected by scuba diver, at Tethys Bay (Ross Sea), between 18 and 35 in depth. The sponges, enveloped in plastic bags underwater just after collection, revealed in the laboratory the presence of a structured epibiotic assembly on their surface. This assembly appears to be "stratified" into three zones: (1) the sponge body, (2) the sponge basal platform, and (3) a zone in which valves of the scallop Adamussium colbecki are embedded into the sponge itself to stabilise it (snow-shoe effect), if the sponge lives on soft bottoms. Some biological interactions occur inside this epibiotic assembly, ranging from direct predation (mollusc vs sponge) to probable commensalisms (isopod vs mollusc). The hosted mollusc belongs to an Atlanto-Mediterranean bathyal genus (Krachia) never before recognised in Antarctica.

AB We determined whether temporal variation and succession were similar among sites with similar species composition by sampling unmanipulated and cleared plots in a high intertidal assemblage dominated by Endocladia muricata and Mastocarpus papillatus. Sampling was done for 6 years at six sites spanning over 4degrees of latitude in California. Ten 1 x 2-m permanent plots were chosen in the central portion of the assemblage at each site. Four of these served as unmanipulated controls, three were cleared (scraped and burned) in the spring of 1985, and three were cleared in the fall of 1985. The cover of sessile and density of motile species were determined by subsampling within the plots from 1985 until 1991. Recovery of the clearings was determined by their similarity to the controls. The algae E. muricata, M. papillatus, and Fucus gardneri, and the barnacle Balanus glandula, were the most abundant sessile organisms in the control plots, although the latter never exceeded 12% cover at any site. The grazing gastropods Littorina scutulata/plena, various limpets, and Tegula funebralis were the most common mobile organisms. The species composition of the common species remained constant in the control plots over the study period and there were few large changes in relative abundance. Significant seasonal variation was detected in 11 species but variation was commonly site-specific.
   Ephemeral algae were abundant during early succession at only two of the six sites, and barnacle cover was low (< 15% cover) at four sites and moderate (15-50% cover) at the remaining two throughout succession. Recovery rate varied considerably among sites and between times of clearing (1-10%/month). Correlations between ephemeral algae and grazer abundance, and between these variables and recovery rate were not significant. The effects of grazers on recovery rate were only evident at one site where they appeared to reduce an initially high cover of ephemeral algae and delay the establishment of perennials. Some of the largest differences in recovery rate were between clearing times, associated with differences in the phenology of the dominant perennial algae. In spite of these differences, most plots recovered by the end of the study period.
   These results indicate that the assemblages in the control plots at each site were relatively stable and, while successional pathways and processes varied, the assemblage at most sites still recovered. Current models, based largely on biological interactions, that attempt to explain within assemblage structure and succession were not broadly applicable. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Plant roots play diverse roles in the rhizosphere. They function as organs responsible for structural support, for acquisition of mineral and water resources, and for fostering of symbiotic bacteria and fungi. They also sustain a complex food web of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in, on, and near the root. In addition to these well-known functions, roots have a recently discovered role with potentially profound coevolutionary implications for the rhizosphere food web, as well as for terrestrial ecological communities in general. Roots are both a source and a receptor of molecular signals important for mutualistic bacteria and perhaps other soil organisms. Fluid-borne rhizosphere compounds flow in the opposite direction from airborne signals that emanate from plant shoots. The powerful transpiration stream around roots naturally concentrates molecular data in a cafeteria of information about the surrounding soil. These molecular signals, such as N-acylated homoserine lactones and phenazines produced by bacteria, can be interpreted simultaneously by multiple species as well as by the root. We propose a model of multitrophic molecular signals in the rhizosphere that implies multiple roles of roots, as hosts, regulators, and sustainers of terrestrial productivity. We suggest a framework of regulation in the rhizosphere that functions through molecular "control points." We define control points as regulatory elements that are operated on by selection processes to confer fitness on individual organisms and thereby have effects that propagate through other trophic levels. Identification of a control point creates a hypothesis that can be tested to assess the quantitative significance of that regulatory element. Some control points may transmit or perceive signals between organisms, but others probably integrate changing environmental conditions or external resources into individual life histories and community functions. The promise of understanding the new molecular signals is that genes must closely underlie these control points. This could offer ecology access to the power of molecular biology and allow a deep understanding of the evolutionary significance of these phenomena. One major strength of rhizospheres for addressing these issues is that realistic ecological interactions can be examined in a restricted microcosm under environmentally controlled conditions with organisms whose genomes have been completely defined and/or partially modified.

TI Host mortality, predation and the evolution of parasite virulence

AB One of the most accepted views in the theoretical literature on virulence evolution is that a parasite's virulence will evolve to higher levels when its host's background mortality rate increases. Surprisingly, however, although many sources of background mortality involve predation, there has not yet been any theoretical research that explicitly considers how the dynamics of this important ecological interaction affects virulence evolution. Here, we consider how predation affects virulence evolution by explicitly introducing a predator into a classical susceptible-infected-susceptible epidemiological model. We find that, contrary to previous predictions, different sources of host mortality affect virulence evolution in different ways. Moreover, the way in which virulence evolution is affected depends on how tightly coupled the predator's dynamics are to the host population, and this can result in somewhat counterintuitive results. For example, indirect ecological effects can cause elevated host mortality to result in the evolution of lower parasite virulence, even if this elevated mortality arises from factors unrelated to predation.

AB Organisms are often confronted with multiple enemy species. Defenses against different parasite species may be traded off against each other. However, if resistance is based on (potentially costly) general defense mechanisms, it may be positively correlated among parasites. In an experimental study, we confronted 19 clones from one Daphnia magna population with two bacterial and three microsporidian parasite species. All parasites were isolated from the same pond as the hosts. Host clones were specific in their susceptibility towards different parasite species, and parasite species were host-clone specific in their infectivity, spore production, and virulence, resulting in highly significant host-parasite interactions. Since the Daphnia's resistance to different parasite species showed no obvious correlation, neither general defense mechanisms nor trade-offs in resistance explain our findings. None of the Daphnia clones were resistant to all parasite species, and the average level of resistance was quite similar among clones. This may reflect a cost of defense, so that the cumulative cost of being resistant to all parasite species might be too high.

AB 1. Following the accidental introduction of the bostrichid beetle Prostephanus truncatus into East and West Africa around 1980, a classical biological control campaign was launched in 1991; the histerid beetle Teretrius nigrescens was released as a biocontrol agent to prevent the destructive outbreak of the pest in small-farm maize stores. However, while the campaign has been ongoing, so has discussion in the scientific community about the merits of this campaign and its chances of success.
   2. From published and unpublished data from experimental maize stores in Benin, West Africa, we derived statistical models describing the in-store insect population dynamics, and were thus able to point out significant biological interactions and to explain the observed lack of biological control.
   3. We found that (i) T. nigrescens reduced significantly the population growth rate of both P. truncatus and the non-target pest, the weevil Sitophilus zeamais ; (ii) T. nigrescens displayed a positive numerical response to both prey species, P. truncatus and S. zeamais ; (iii) asymmetric competition existed between the two prey species, S. zeamais was negatively affected by P. truncatus but not vice versa; (iv) T. nigrescens and S. zeamais displayed negative intraspecific density-dependence whereas P. truncatus was resource-limited.
   4. We conclude that classical biological control with T. nigrescens is not likely to become successful, mainly due to the predator's intraspecific density-dependence and its low population growth rate compared with its prey. We recommend that further research on P. truncatus integrated pest management takes into account the farmer as an active agent managing the store.
   5. Synthesis and applications. When biocontrol does not result in satisfactory pest control, as in the case of P. truncatus , farmers should learn how to scout for the pest and take action when a need is detected. In areas where the pest is usually only a minor problem, the agricultural extension service should consider setting up a simple early warning system for their region. When attempts at classical biological control remain unsuccessful, as in the case of P. truncatus now for 10 years, policy-makers should prioritize training of extension service and farmers in integrated pest management techniques (e.g. need-based use of insecticides) as a necessary supplement to biocontrol.

AB 1 Most plant demographic studies follow marked individuals in permanent plots. Plots tend to be small, so detectability is assumed to be one for every individual. However, detectability could be affected by factors such as plant traits, time, space, observer, previous detection, biotic interactions, and especially by life-state.
   2 We used a double-observer survey and closed population capture-recapture modelling to estimate state-specific detectability of the orchid Cleistes bifaria in a long-term study plot of 41.2 m(2). Based on AIC(c) model selection, detectability was different for each life-state and for tagged vs. previously untagged plants. There were no differences in detectability between the two observers.
   3 Detectability estimates (SE) for one-leaf vegetative, two-leaf vegetative, and flowering/fruiting states correlated with mean size of these states and were 0.76 (0.05), 0.92 (0.06), and 1 (0.00), respectively, for previously tagged plants, and 0.84 (0.08), 0.75 (0.22), and 0 (0.00), respectively, for previously untagged plants. (We had insufficient data to obtain a satisfactory estimate of previously untagged flowering plants).
   4 Our estimates are for a medium-sized plant in a small and intensively surveyed plot. It is possible that detectability is even lower for larger plots and smaller plants or smaller life-states (e.g. seedlings) and that detectabilities < 1 are widespread in plant demographic studies.
   5 State-dependent detectabilities are especially worrying since they will lead to a size- or state-biased sample from the study plot. Failure to incorporate detectability into demographic estimation methods introduces a bias into most estimates of population parameters such as fecundity, recruitment, mortality, and transition rates between life-states. We illustrate this by a simple example using a matrix model, where a hypothetical population was stable but, due to imperfect detection, wrongly projected to be declining at a rate of 8% per year.
   6 Almost all plant demographic studies are based on models for discrete states. State and size are important predictors both for demographic rates and detectability. We suggest that even in studies based on small plots, state- or size-specific detectability should be estimated at least at some point to avoid biased inference about the dynamics of the population sampled.

AB Many ecological studies have addressed issues of vegetation spatial patterns in attempts to understand the processes generating them. We investigated changes in ecological processes during succession via the analysis of shrubs' spatial patterns in a system of linear sand dunes, an and ecosystem located in the Negev Desert in Israel during three consecutive years. We hypothesized that spatial patterns change from clustered to regular as succession progresses due to changes in the relative importance of facilitation and competition in this environment. In this ecosystem communities of early successional stages are frequently disturbed by high rates of sand movement, whereas in later successional stages sand stability is high. We mapped in the field individual shrubs on high-resolution aerial photographs, and converted the digital images to a GIS data set. Using Ripley's K-function we analysed spatial patterns at three levels: the single-species level, among species and at the individual level, in three communities characterizing different successional stages. In the early successional communities we found clustered spatial patterns, in comparison with stable habitats where spatial patterns tended to be regular. We argue that these shifts in spatial patterns are indicative of the assumption that in this sand-dune system ecological interactions change from facilitation to competition as succession progresses. Further, we argue that these interactions operate in different spatial scales at the different successional stages, and that the study of these processes should be conducted at the spatial scales specific to each community.

AB During the colder climates of the Pleistocene, the ranges of high-elevation species in unglaciated areas may have expanded, leading to increased gene flow among previously isolated populations. The phylogeography of the pygmy salamander, Desmognathus wrighti , an endemic species restricted to the highest mountain peaks of the southern Appalachians, was examined to test the hypothesis that the range of D. wrighti expanded along with other codistributed taxa during the Pleistocene. Analyses of genetic variation at 14 allozymic loci and of the 12S rRNA gene in the mtDNA genome was conducted on individuals sampled from 14 population isolates throughout the range of D. wrighti . In contrast to the genetic patterns of many other high-elevation animals and plants, genetic distances derived from both molecular markers showed significant isolation by distance and genetic structuring of populations, suggesting long-term isolation of populations. Phylogeographical analyses revealed four genetically distinct population clusters that probably remained fragmented during the Pleistocene, although there was also evidence supporting recent gene flow among some population groups. Support for isolation by distance is rare among high-elevation species in unglaciated areas of North and Middle America, although not uncommon among Plethodontid Salamanders, and this pattern suggests that populations of D. wrighti did not expand entirely into suitable habitat during the Pleistocene. We propose that intrinsic barriers to dispersal, such as species interactions with other southern Appalachian plethodontid salamanders, persisted during the Pleistocene to maintain the fragmented distribution of D. wrighti and allow for significant genetic divergence of populations by restricting gene flow.

AB Honeybees communicate the distance and location of resource patches by bee dances, but this spatial information has rarely been used to study their foraging ecology. We analysed, for the first time to the best of the authors' knowledge, foraging distances and dance activities of honeybees in relation to landscape structure, season and colony using a replicated experimental approach on a landscape scale. We compared three structurally simple landscapes characterized by a high proportion of arable land and large patches, with three complex landscapes with a high proportion of semi-natural perennial habitats and low mean patch size. Four observation hives were placed in the centre of the landscapes and switched at regular intervals between the six landscapes from the beginning of May to the end of July.
   A total of 1137 bee dances were observed and decoded. Overall mean foraging distance was 1526.1 +/- 37.2 m, the median 1181.5 m and range 62.1-10 037.1 m. Mean foraging distances of all bees and foraging distances of nectar-collecting bees did not significantly differ between simple and complex landscapes, but varied between month and colonies. Foraging distances of pollen-collecting bees were significantly larger in simple (1743 +/- 95.6 m) than in complex landscapes (1543.4 +/- 71 m) and highest in June when resources were scarce. Dancing activity, i.e. the number of observed bee dances per unit time, was significantly higher in complex than in simple landscapes, presumably because of larger spatial and temporal variability of resource patches in complex landscapes. The results facilitate an understanding of how human landscape modification may change the evolutionary significance of bee dances and ecological interactions, such as pollination and competition between honeybees and other bee species.

AB We previously examined competitive interactions among viruses by allowing the RNA phage Phi6 to evolve at high and low multiplicities of infection (ratio of infecting viruses to bacterial cells). Derived high-multiplicity phages were competitively advantaged relative to their ancestors during coinfection, but their fixation caused population fitness to decline. These data conform to the evolution of lowered fitness in a population of defectors, as expected from the Prisoner's Dilemma of game theory. However, the generality of this result is unknown; the evolution of viruses at other multiplicities may alter the fitness payoffs associated with conflicting strategies of cooperation and defection. Here we examine the change in matrix variables by propagating the ancestor under strictly clonal conditions, allowing cooperation the chance to evolve. In competitions involving derived cooperators and their selfish counterparts, our data reveal a new outcome where the two strategies are predicted to coexist in a mixed polymorphism. Thus, we demonstrate that the payoff matrix is not a constant in Phi6. Rather, clonal selection allows viruses the opportunity to escape the Prisoner's Dilemma We discuss mechanisms that may afford selfish genotypes an advantage during intrahost competition and the relevance in our system for alternative ecological interactions among viruses.

AB Communities high in species diversity tend to be more successful in resisting invaders than those low in species diversity. It has been proposed that the biotic resistance offered by native predators, competitors and disease organisms plays a role. In Yaquina Bay, Oregon, we observed very little overlap in the distribution of the invasive European green crab, Carcinus maenas, and the larger red rock crab, Cancer productus. C. productus dominates the more saline, cooler lower estuary and C. maenas, the less saline, warmer upper estuary. Because caged C. maenas survive well in the lower estuary, we decided to test the hypothesis that C. productus prey on C. maenas and thus contribute to their exclusion from the more physically benign lower estuary. A laboratory species interaction experiment was designed to determine whether C. productus preys on smaller C. maenas at a higher rate than on smaller crabs of their own species. Crabs of both species were collected and sorted by weight into three size classes: small, medium and large. Small and medium crabs of both species were paired with C. maenas and C. productus of various sizes. When conspecifics were paired, mortality was less than 14%, even in the presence of larger crabs. Smaller C. productus survived well in the presence of larger C. maenas, but the reverse was not true. When small C. maenas (60-67 mm carapace width) were matched with medium and large C. productus, their mortality increased to 52% and 76%, respectively. A less dramatic pattern was observed for medium C. maenas (73-80 mm) in the presence of medium and large C. productus. Thus on the West Coast of North America, the more aggressive red rock crab, C. productus, has the potential to reduce the abundance of C. maenas in the more saline and cooler lower estuaries.

AB We conducted experimental manipulations and field observations to determine the role of members of a nectarivorous guild (pollinators and robbers) on nectar production and pollen deposition in Hamelia patens at the La Selva Biological Station (Costa Rica). Seven pollinators (hummingbirds) and four robbers (I hummingbird and 3 perching birds) comprised the avian nectarivorous guild visiting H. patens during March 1997. In addition, two florivorous birds were observed visiting H. patens during the study. Pollinators accounted for 85.6 percent of the visits, robbers for 12.4 percent, and florivores for 2 percent of the visits. Visitation by pollinators and robbers was greatest when floral nectar was highest. No aggressive interactions between pollinators and robbers were observed during the study. Pollinators differed in their ability to carry and deposit pollen on the stigma. Territorial hummingbirds were the least effective pollinators but the most frequent visitors. Flowers were frequently robbed (71%) during the study. Flowers experimentally robbed did not increase nectar production compared to control flowers; therefore, robbery may not involve an extra energy investment in terms of nectar production. The number of pollen grains deposited on artificially robbed flowers was significantly less than the number found in flowers with extra nectar (nectar added) but did not differ from the number found in non-manipulated flowers, indicating that nectar robbers may not affect the foraging behavior of hummingbirds, and therefore pollen deposition.

AB Tropical stream food webs are thought to be based primarily on terrestrial resources (leaf litter) in small forested headwater streams and algal resources in larger, wider streams. In tropical island streams, the dominant consumers are often omnivorous freshwater shrimps that consume algae, leaf litter, insects, and other shrimps. We used stable isotope analysis to examine (1) the relative importance of terrestrial and algal-based food resources to shrimps and other consumers and determine (2) if the relative importance of these food resources changed along the stream continuum. We examined delta(15)N and delta(13)C signatures of leaves, algae, macrophyles, biofilm, insects, snails, fishes, and shrimps at three sites (300, 90, and 10 In elev.) along the Rio Espiritu Santo, which drains the Caribbean National Forest, Puerto Rico. Isotope signatures of basal resources were distinct at all sites. Results of two-source delta(13)C mixing models suggest that shrimps relied more on algal-based carbon resources than terrestrially derived resources at all three sites along the continuum. This study supports other recent findings in tropical streams, demonstrating that algal-based resources are very important to stream consumers, even in small forested headwater streams. This study also demonstrates the importance of doing assimilation-based analysis (i.e., stable isotope or trophic basis of production) when studying food webs.

AB We compare qualitative predictions of press perturbation response from community matrix models with those of a range of numerical simulations on the same models. A technique of weighting the proportion of countervailing feedback cycles in qualitative response predictions (weighted predictions) was tested against quantitative predictions from the inverse community matrix. Specifically, in nine each of 5- and 10- variable models (of varying complexity) we randomly assigned quantitative values of interaction strength and measured correspondence with qualitative predictions in terms of response strength and sign. Based on the techniques and analyses presented herein, we report an expanded scope of inference for qualitative models of any size and complexity and conclude that system structure is of overriding importance.

AB Search biases-behaviours that intentionally or unintentionally affect a forager's encounter probability with its resources-can have profound ecological and evolutionary effects. Courchamp et al (2000) introduced a model of asymmetric apparent competition (hyperpredation) that incorporated a search bias influenced by the frequency,of prey. We extend their model and assess the effects of a frequency-dependent search bias on the direct and indirect effects among a predator and two prey. We derive lines of equal harvest for the predator. These lines give all combinations of the abundances of the two prey such that the predator has the same harvest rate. (The predator's zero net growth isocline is the equal harvest rate line that just meets the predator's subsistence demand for energy.) All equal harvest rate lines have similar shapes, and all have regions of both positive and negative slope within the state space of prey densities. When they have a positive slope, one prey decreases the predator's harvest rate and total fitness. This leads to an indirect interaction between the prey types that mimics exploitation (+, -). Under this 'apparent exploitation', one prey indirectly harms the second, while the second indirectly benefits the first. At other prey densities when the predator's line of equal harvest rate has a negative slope, the prey interact indirectly through apparent competition (Holt, 1977, 1983). Our model provides an extension of Martin's (1988a,b) verbal model, in which nest predators, through density-dependent foraging and search images, select for nest site diversification among co-occurring bird species. Our model shows when Martin's hypothesis may and may not apply.

ID STABILITY
AB Standard population models in ecology and evolutionary ecology assume that all individuals are identical and reproduce by cloning. Often, the connection between evolutionary ecology, genetics and mating systems is not explicit. Functionally similar species are modelled with separate equations (e.g. 'competing' species). Here, a theory is developed that: (i) views a population as a distribution of individuals over adaptive character values; (ii) identifies various evolutionary types (e.g. species) with special points along this distribution; (iii) treats individuals as different with respect to the adaptive character value; (iv) incorporates ecological interactions among individuals along distributions; and (v) incorporates assortative mating and mutations.
   A stable equilibrium distribution of individuals over the adaptive character (the strategy) is a distributed evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS). At the distributed ESS, individuals may be equally distributed over all values of the adaptive character. Conditions that give rise to a non-uniform distributed ESS are analysed. Organisms are classified into types-an abstract classification for which species, phenotypes, and so on are special cases. With distributions, when the stable distribution is not homogeneous with respect to the adaptive character, it makes no sense to talk about the fitness of an individual in isolation from that of others. We talk about a fitness distribution. At a distributed ESS, the distribution of fitness is stable and different individuals have different values of the adaptive character.
   The theory is extended to multiple characters and functionally different organisms (predators, prey, etc.). It remains intact with evolution of multiple characters with multiple ecological interactions in space and with mutations and assortative mating. A way to link distributed evolutionarily stable strategies to genetic mechanisms is outlined.

AB Livestock and wildlife managers must be aware of the nutritional dynamics of forages to sustain satisfactory growth and reproduction of their animals and assure fair value for pasture. Despite a history of livestock grazing in the northern Great Basin, annual and seasonal mineral concentrations of many of the region's prominent grasses have not been measured. We addressed this problem with monthly sampling (April-November) of 7 cool-season grasses at 6 sites during 1992, a drier than average year (86% of mean precipitation), and 1993 when precipitation was 167% of average (255 mm). Grasses included: Poa sandbergii Vasey, Bromus tectorum L., Sitanion hystrix (Nutt.) Smith, Agropyron spicatum (Pursh) Scribn. & Smith, Festuca idahoensis Elmer, Stipa thurberiana Piper, and Elymus cinereus Scrilm. & Merr. Phosphorus, K, Ca, Mg, Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, and Na were assayed, and initial statistical analysis was a split-split-plot with main effects of species, years, and months and all possible interactions. For a preponderance of the minerals, (Zn and Na excluded) the 3-way year x month x species interactions were significant (P<0.05) indicating that main effects did not function independently. Generally, mineral concentrations averaged about 41% higher among the grasses for the drier of the 2 years (1992). Copper, Zn, and Na concentrations were below required levels for beef cattle (9.9, 28.8, and 672 mg kg(-1), respectively) among all the grasses for all sampling periods. Seasonally deficient minerals included Ca, Mg, P, K, and Mn. Calcium and Mn were largely deficient (<3.2 and 1.15 g kg(-1), respectively) for beef cattle early in the growing season with levels rising as grasses matured. Seasonal patterns of Mg were variable among the grasses, increasing in some as the season progressed, remaining stable among others, and declining with maturity in yet others. Phosphorus and K levels were typically adequate (>1.94 and 5.76 g kg(-1), respectively) for beef cattle early in the growing season and declined to deficient levels by July and August. Iron was of no concern, because concentrations were more than adequate for cattle (>48 mg kg(-1)) among all the grasses for all seasons. While a mixed stand of forages can extend the period of adequate mineral nutrition for cattle in some instances, we suggest that a supplement be available season-long on northern Great Basin rangelands and that the formulation include at least Ca, Mg, P, K, Cu, Zn, Mn, and Na in available forms and proper ratios.

AB Prescribed fires are important for rangeland restoration and affect plant community composition and species interactions. Many rangeland plant communities have been, or are under the threat of noxious weed invasion, however there is little information on how fire effects weeds. Our objective was to determine the effects of prescribed rangeland fire on dalmatian toadflax [Linaria dalmatica (L.) Miller] density, cover, biomass, and seed production. These plant characteristics, as well as density, cover, and biomass of perennial grasses and forbs were measured within burned and adjacent not-burned areas on 3 Artemisia tridentata/Agropyron spicatum habitat types in Montana. Areas were burned in the spring and measured in the fall 1999. Comparisons of plant characteristics between the burned and not-burned sites were made using t-tests and non-parametric Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests. After 1 growing season, fire did not affect density or cover of dalmatian toadflax. Burning increased dalmatian toadflax biomass per square meter at 2 sites, and per plant biomass at all 3 sites. Seed production of dalmatian toadflax was increased by fire at all 3 sites. Fire reduced forb cover at 1 site and increased grass biomass at 2 sites. The increases in dalmatian toadflax biomass and seed production suggest that fire used to restore healthy plant communities may increase dalmatian toadflax dominance. We recommend weed management procedures, such as herbicide control and seeding desirable species, be integrated with prescribed fire where dalmatian toadflax is present in the plant community.

AB The outcome of experimental manipulations in ecology should depend on the duration of the experiment. We tested this proposition by examining the results of published trophic cascade experiments in freshwater communities and the results of our own previously unpublished pond experiment. In particular, we analyze the results of 90 published trophic cascade experiments to test the prediction that the outcome of freshwater trophic cascade experiments, in which zooplanktivorous fish are either present or absent, depends on the duration of the experiment. We present evidence that there are quantitative differences in the strength of trophic cascades among different venue types (enclosure, mesocosm, pond, and lake), but that the strength of trophic cascades does not diminish with increasing experiment duration. Despite the large number of studies, there have been few replicated studies of trophic cascades for longer than a summer field season, and none for the time required to estimate the long-term result of press perturbations. We therefore present the results of a 4-year study of trophic cascades in experimental ponds, to test the predictions that the addition of the top predator results in a sustained increase in the phytoplankton biomass. We found that, as predicted by our literature review, there was no decline in the strength of the trophic cascade as the experiment progressed.

AB This study documents substantial variation in reproductive traits among populations of stream-dwelling brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) at a very small geographic scale. Within two streams, we found a parallel pattern of variation, where females living above major waterfalls produced fewer and larger eggs than conspecifics from below the waterfalls. Four additional streams were represented with either a below-waterfall site (n = 2) or all above-waterfall site (n = 2). When these streams were included in the analyses, there was no consistent difference in reproductive traits between females from above- and below-waterfall sites. There was no significant difference in total reproductive investment among sites within streams, but considerable variation among streams. Female first-year growth rates was estimated from scales, and differed significantly among populations. Within streams, females from below waterfalls experienced higher first-year growth rates as compared to females from above the waterfalls. Within seven Out of eight populations, egg size increased significantly with increasing female body length. Within three Populations, we found evidence for a trade-off between offspring size and offspring number, as a negative association between fecundity and egg size independently of adult body size. Within three populations egg size decreased significantly with increasing maternal first-year growth, independently of adult body size. We suggest that the within-stream differences in offspring size/number strategies are influenced by population density and growth effects. Earlier, we have shown that population densities are consistently lower below the waterfalls in these streams. The Alpine bullhead (Cottus poecilopus) is found only below the waterfalls and could influence brown trout demography.

AB Meadow voles, Microtus pennsylvanicus, affect the species composition, distribution, and succession of plants in grassland ecosystems, but the effects of voles on herbaceous plants when grasslands are bordered by wooded edges is not known. We investigated the impact of wooded edges on vole distribution and herbivory of relatively palatable and unpalatable native prairie plant species by studying five reconstructed tallgrass prairies with wooded edges in central Iowa. A 50 x 50 m trapping grid at each site was established to determine the proportion of voles captured at various distances from the edge. We found that meadow voles were less abundant at wooded edges and, in general, increased in number toward the prairie interior. Seedlings Of purple prairie clover (Dalea purpurea) and Illinois bundleflower (Desmanthus illinoensis), a relatively palatable and unpalatable species, respectively, were transplanted onto simulated gopher mounds 2, 5, 10 20 and 30 in from the edge. The number of plants grazed per species per Mound was determined 1 week and 4 weeks after planting. The amount of herbivory on both species was significantly different by distance, with fewer plants eaten 2 in from the edge. Interestingly, file amount of herbivory on relatively unpalatable plants did not differ from more palatable plants. Herbivory on both plant species also varied by site, such that sites with lower vole density tended to have lower amounts of herbivory. These results indicate that wooded edges do have an effect on meadow vole distribution and native prairie seedling herbivory. Because voles avoid wooded edges, seedlings of any species may experience a small refuge from herbivory along wooded edges.

AB The evolution of a population by individual-level natural selection can result in the population's extinction. Selection causes the spread of phenotypes with higher relative fitness, but at the same time, selection can also indirectly produce changes in the physical, biotic, or genotypical environment through population interactions (e. g., environment modification, interspecific interactions, and genomic conflict). Because fitness is environment dependent, this can cause mean fitness to decrease, resulting in extinction. I call this process "Darwinian extinction." Examples of Darwinian extinction include a variety of dynamics and modes of extinction, but the variation is constrained. I determine the complete classification of possible dynamics and modes of Darwinian extinction due to ecological interactions, using bifurcation theory and models with ecological and evolutionary changes occurring on different timescales. This classification is also extended to extinctions due to interactions within the population. The mode of extinction may be either sudden or gradual (requiring additional stochastic processes), and each mode has specific types of dynamics associated with it. Darwinian extinction is a robust and normal phenomenon, and this reasonably complete classification can help us understand more thoroughly its role in nature.

AB Leaves and stems of bilberry were analysed for phenolic metabolites using a simple method of extraction and HPLC analysis. Hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives (HCAs) and flavonoids were identified on the basis of their UV-spectra. Temporal fluctuations in the levels of selected phenolic compounds were followed during the growth season of 2000. Qualitative and quantitative differences were detected in phenolic profiles between leaf and stem tissues. The most abundant peak in. leaf samples was tentatively identified as chlorogenic acid (5-O-caffeoylquinic acid). In stems, this compound was found at much lower levels than in leaves and an unidentified p-coumaric acid derivative dominated the phenolic profile. The most abundant flavonols in leaves and stems were quercetin derivatives. The total sum of methanol-soluble phenolics was generally higher in leaves than in stems. The concentrations of some alkaline hydrolysis products were higher in stems than in leaves, indicating that a larger part of the phenolic pool was incorporated into lignified cell walls in the stems. Individual phenolic compounds differed in their seasonal fluctuation patterns. It is suggested that the observed plant-part specific and within-seasonal variation may influence the ecological interactions between bilberry and its natural enemies. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

ID VEGETATION
AB The patches of Paspalum quadrifarium-dominated grasslands found at present could be remnants of the vegetation that defined the Pampas landscape in the past. The mere presence of such physical structures should lead to systems in which many other species are dependent upon both the autogenic creation of surface area for living space and the autogenic and allogenic modulation of resources controlled by these structures. We carried out a mensurative-comparative study in naturally occurring sites dominated by P. quadrifarium that occupy different positions within the landscape in the Flooding Pampa. We found different species assemblages in these structurally homogeneous stands, related to the edaphic and topographic gradients. The comparison with sites from similar positions in the landscape where this native tussock-grass was absent showed that the dominance of P. quadrifarium is a minor determinant of floristic differences, which are mainly controlled by abiotic factors. We assigned these dominated grassland stands to previously delimited vegetation units for the Flooding Pampa grasslands and we compared them with the vegetation units assigned, in terms of composite properties of the community that may be indicators of ecosystem processes, such as biological invasions and productivity. Our results show that this native tussock grass is associated with higher floristic richness, higher representation of perennials and grasses and lower presence of alien plants. This homogeneous pattern of variation across the vegetation units would suggest that, despite the absence of dramatic changes in community composition, the dominance of this tussock grass plays an important role in structuring species diversity patterns.

AB The main aim of this work is to present a new dynamic model to predict bacterioplankton production and biomass. This model has been developed as a submodel within the framework of a more comprehensive lake ecosystem model, LakeWeb, which is based on nine key functional groups of organisms. Beside bacterioplankton, LakeWeb accounts for phytoplankton, two types of zooplankton (herbivorous and predatory), two types of fish (prey and predatory), as well as zoobenthos, macrophytes and benthic algae. The model uses ordinary differential equations and gives seasonal (weekly) variations and accounts in a general way for all major abiotic/biotic interactions and feedbacks for entire lakes (the ecosystem, approach). The new dynamic model has not been calibrated and tested in the traditional way using data from one or a few well-investigated lakes. Instead, it has been calibrated using empirical regressions based on data from many fakes. We have presented empirical reference models utilising data from a new database, which includes many lakes situated in the former Soviet Union. They were investigated during the Soviet period and those results have been largely unknown in the West. The basic aim of the dynamic model is that it should capture typical functional and structural patterns in many lakes. We have given algorithms for (1) bacterioplankton production, (2) elimination (related-to the turnover time of bacterioplankton), (3) bacterioplankton consumption by herbivorous zooplankton, and the factors influencing these processes/rates. We have demonstrated that the new dynamic model gives predictions that agree well with the values given by the empirical reference models, and also expected and requested divergences from these regressions when they do not provide sufficient resolution. the new. dynamic model is driven by data easily accessed from standard monitoring programs or maps and meant to be of practical use in lake management.

AB Models and experiments of the evolution of age- and/or size-at-maturation in response to population harvesting have consistently shown that selective harvesting of older and larger individuals can cause earlier maturation. These predictions, however, are all based on single-species considerations and thus crucially neglect the selective forces caused or mediated by species interactions. Here we develop simple models of phenotypic evolution of age-at-first-reproduction in a prey population subject to different types of predation and harvesting. We show that, in the presence of natural predation, the potential evolutionary response of age-at-first-reproduction to population harvesting is ambiguous: harvesting can cause either earlier or later maturation depending on the type of predator interaction and its strength relative to the fishing pressure. The counterintuitive consequences of harvesting result from the indirect effects that harvesting of a prey population has on the selection pressure exerted by its natural predator, since this selection pressure itself typically depends on prey density. If harvest rates are high, the direct selection pressures considered in classical analyses prevail and harvesting decreases the age-at-first-reproduction, whereas at lower harvest rates the indirect, inter-specifically mediated effects of harvesting can qualitatively overturn predictions based on simpler single-species models.

AB 1. Larvae of cased caddisflies (Limnephilidae and Phryganeidae) are among the most abundant and conspicuous invertebrates in northern wetlands. Although species replacements are often observed along permanence gradients, the underlying causal mechanisms are poorly understood. In this paper, we report on the distributional patterns of caddisflies in permanent and temporary high-altitude ponds, and how those patterns reflect differences in life history characteristics that affect desiccation tolerance (fundamental niches) versus constraints related to biotic interactions (realised niches).
   2. Species (Hesperophylax occidentalis and Agrypnia deflata ) that were encountered only in permanent ponds are restricted in distribution by life history (no ovarian diapause, aquatic oviposition, and/or inability to tolerate desiccation). Although the egg masses of H. occidentalis tolerate desiccation, the larvae leave the protective gelatinous matrix of the egg mass because adults oviposit in water.
   3. Three species (Asynarchus nigriculus, Limnephilus externus and L. picturatus ) have life history characteristics (rapid larval growth, ovarian diapause and terrestrial oviposition of desiccation-tolerant eggs) that should facilitate the use of both permanent and temporary habitats. However, A. nigriculus is rare or absent in most permanent ponds, and L. externus and L . picturatus are rare or absent in most temporary ponds. Experimental data from a previous study on the combined effects of salamander predation and interspecific interactions among caddisflies (e.g. intraguild predation) suggest that biotic interactions limit each species to a subset of potentially exploitable habitats.
   4. Many wetland invertebrates exhibit species replacements along permanence gradients, but few studies have separated the relative importance of the effects of drying per se from the effects of biotic interactions. Our results emphasise the complementary roles of comparative data on life histories and experimental data on competition and predation for understanding invertebrate distributions along permanence gradients.

AB 1. Assessing the effects on communities of invasive species is often confounded by environmental factors. In Irish rivers, the introduced amphipod Gammarus pulex replaces the native G. duebeni celticus in lowland stretches. The two amphipods are associated with different macroinvertebrate communities, which may in part be the result of natural longitudinal physicochemical change. However, this hinders assessment of any direct community impacts of the invasive as compared with the native species. Here, we report on a fortuitous circumstance that allowed us to uncouple the community effects of Gammarus species from environmental differences.
   2. The lowland stretch of the River Lissan is dissected by a weir, which has slowed the upstream invasion by G. pulex . We took physicochemical measurements and macroinvertebrate samples from three contiguous 150 m reaches of this stretch with G. pulex only, mixed Gammarus and G. d. celticus only communities.
   3. We found no biologically significant differences in physicochemistry among the three reaches. Overall invertebrate densities did not differ among reaches. However, G. pulex numerically dominated its reach, whilst G. d. celticus abundance was relatively low in its reach. The G. pulex reach had significantly higher overall biomass because of high invader abundance. In addition, both diversity and species richness of macroinvertebrate communities were lower in the G. pulex than the G. d. celticus reach, with the mixed Gammarus reach intermediate.
   4. Ordination indicated distinctly different associations of invertebrate community samples and taxa that were best explained by the distributions of the Gammarus species. Again, the mixed Gammarus species samples were intermediate.
   5. This study indicates that the invasive G. pulex has a greater impact on macroinvertebrate community composition than the native G. d. celticus , probably through biotic interactions such as predation.

AB The importance of positive interspecific interactions within physically stressful habitats has received increased attention from community ecologists. The exposed sandy beach is an example of a physically rigorous environment where biological interactions have long been considered insignificant. We examined the interaction between the infaunal clam, Donax variabilis, and the hydroid, Lovenella gracilis, on exposed sandy beaches in North Carolina. Epibiotic occupation of Donax by hydroids has been repeatedly observed on ocean beaches but rarely investigated. By providing a stable substrate for attachment, the clam facilitates the persistence of the hydroid in the intertidal beach; however, benefits or costs experienced by the host as a result of this association are unknown. By exposing clams with and without hydroid colonies to multiple types of clam predators, we tested the effectiveness of the hydroid, which possesses stinging nematocysts, in defending its host. The hydroid defended the clam against one common predator, the Florida pompano (Trachinotus carolinus). Against speckled crabs (Arenaeus cribrarius) and ghost crabs (Ocypode quadrata), however, the hydroid offered no protection for its host and instead facilitated predation. The epibiotic hydroid, which projects above the surface of the sand, allowed the crabs to more readily detect clams below the surface. In the field, we evaluated the effect of the hydroid on the tidally synchronized migrations and bur-rowing speed of the clam. The hydroid, which can form large colonies on the posterior end of the clam, had no effect on Donax burrowing speed, but did reduce the speed of transport of clams by wave swash. Depending on relative predation pressure, the occupation of D. variabilis by L. gracilis can alternately be characterized as beneficial or detrimental to the host.

AB Theoretical and empirical ecologists have long acknowledged that information about the intensity or strength of the interaction between species is crucial for an understanding of community dynamics. In communities in which predation is an important structuring process, and some predator species are commercially exploited, quantitative estimates of predation by different predator species within a guild are necessary to make even the simplest recommendations about conservation and resource management. Here, we evaluated per capita and population level components of predation intensity of three intertidal predators that feed on monospecific stands of barnacles and mussels at wave exposed sites in the rocky intertidal zone of central Chile. These prey species represent the two most distinctive stages of the mid-intertidal seascape, with mussels being competitively dominant. Our results showed that the commercially exploited gastropod Concholepas concholepas and the sea star Heliaster helianthus have similarly large per capita and population effects on the competitively dominant mussel Perumytilus purpuratus. Their per capita (by average size individual) and population effects on mussels were more than two orders of magnitude larger than those of Acanthocyclus gayi crabs and likely even larger than the effect of other predator species in this system (other crabs, whelks, birds, fish). The overall pattern of predation on barnacles was similar to that on mussels, but some differences occurred in the way different components of predation intensity were distributed across predator species. Despite the roughly similar pattern of population predation intensity between prey species, the expected consequences for the prey population, and hence the rest of the community, were acutely different for mussels and barnacles.

AB Overstorey shrub species are known to influence the composition of the understorey in Southern Hemisphere heathlands. Overstorey densities are susceptible to variations in fire frequency; thus, fire regimes may influence overstorey/ understorey interactions and overall floristic composition. We compared patches of Banksia heath which had supported an overstorey during a fire interval of about 30 y with patches where the overstorey was absent during the same period, and tested for differences in species composition as a function of overstorey presence. Floristic composition varied significantly between overstorey patches and open patches. Most species were less abundant in overstorey patches, however some were more abundant. The relative abundance of species in relation to overstorey was unrelated to their fire response, propagule longevity or propagule storage location. There was significantly less biomass in overstorey patches compared with open patches. The effect of the overstorey varied with soil moisture. In a dry area, the number of species was lower in overstorey patches, with fewer herb and shrub species present compared with open patches. Fewer species were recorded in a wetter area, but overstorey had no effect on the number of species recorded. Reduced intensity of competition among understorey species in overstorey patches could be responsible for the higher abundance of some species in these patches. We postulate that full diversity will be maintained when the density of overstorey shrubs fluctuates widely over a relatively short period of time. This is most likely when fire frequency is highly variable.

AB The current high rate of population declines and attempts to 'manage' their recovery, call for a better understanding of recovery dynamics of populations. In many cases, recovery of a population may primarily be determined by a single life history property or ecological interaction, allowing for straightforward management actions. For example, a generalist predator may prevent the recovery of its prey, and populations with sex-biased dispersal are particularly vulnerable to demographic stochasticity. However, linking life history with intra- and interspecific population dynamics is needed to assess the relative importance of these factors. A clear example is depensatory dynamics that can be caused either by e.g., mutual predation or cooperative breeding. Moreover, dynamics of a recovering population can alter both its physiological and behavioural traits, affecting its interspecific interactions. Here we review life histories (reproduction, resource use and dispersal) and species interactions affecting recovery processes, and discuss their implications for management.

ID RESTORATION
AB This paper presents results on how intensive fishing (fish removal) is likely to influence the structure of lake foodwebs. The work is based on a comprehensive dynamic lake ecosystem model, LakeWeb, which accounts for production, biomasses, predation and abiotic/biotic interactions of nine key functional groups of organisms: phytoplankton, bacterioplankton, two types of zooplankton (herbivorous and predatory), two types of fish (prey and predatory), zoobenthos, macrophytes and benthic algae. The model uses ordinary differential equations, the ecosystem scale and gives seasonal variations (the calculation time is 1 week). It is designed to account for all fundamental abiotic/biotic interactions and feedbacks for lakes in general for the nine target groups. The LakeWeb-model has been calibrated and critically tested using empirical data and regressions based on data from many lakes. It has been shown that the model can closely capture typical functional and structural patterns in lakes, which should give credibility to the results presented in this work. Obtaining such results using traditional methods, i.e., extensive field studies in one or a few lakes, would be very demanding (in terms of money, persons involved and time). In this paper, results are presented for two lakes, one Swedish and one Belarussian. The intensive fishing operations carried out in Lake Blacksastjarn, Sweden, to reduce Hg-concentrations in fish did not succeed. A typical cost of an intensive fishing is about 10,000-30,000 USD per lake of this size ( less than or equal to 0.25 km(2)). The costs to remove fish would be about 40-120 USD per kg ww fish removed! Intensive fishing simulated for Lake Batorino, Belarus, to reduce the fish biomass will likely increase the prey fish biomass as long as the predation pressure on prey fish is lower than during the prefishing stage. The biomass of predatory fish will recover only slowly. However, this operation is not likely to succeed in lowering the algal volume in lakes with a high biomass of predatory zooplankton. This is easy to state qualitatively and the LakeWeb-model offers a practically useful tool to quantify such changes and identify lakes where biomanipulations are likely to fail or succeed.

AB We test the idea that species interactions and environmental tolerances translate constrained traits to patterns of species distribution and abundance through a series of trade-offs. First we suggest a framework to classify relationships among traits at different levels of organization. We then synthesize experiments to quantify relationships at these multiple levels for a group of I I prairie plant species that characterize different disturbance regimes. Finally we identify linkages among traits at these different levels and examine how these linkages relate plant traits to patterns of species composition following gap creation.
   Linkages were evident between all levels of response, lending credence to the idea that relationships among organismal traits can shape dynamics of species interactions and thereby translate into abundance patterns. Interestingly the important trade-offs and translators for the set of species we examined were not always the ones predicted by conceptual models. For instance, we found evidence of trade-offs between measures of competitive and tolerance (to soil compaction) abilities, but little evidence of negative correlations between competitive abilities in different environments or between colonization and competitive abilities. Tolerance (to defoliation, shade, drought) and colonization abilities, rather than competitive ability, appeared to be important translators that linked organismal traits to abundance patterns. In addition growth rates of the species under field conditions, but not other measures of demographic success (e.g., survival, seedbank density), were related to the species distributions due to soil disturbance. Although our results support the idea that trade-offs scale across several levels of organization, specific predictions of several well-known hypotheses are not borne out along all levels of organization and other, less emphasized trade-offs appear to be as important in our study system.

AB Analyses of growth response to resource availability are the basis for interpreting whether trophic trade-offs contribute to diversity. If different species respond most to resources that are limiting at different times, then those differences may trade off with other trophic or life-history traits that, together, help to maintain diversity. The statistical models used to infer trophic differences do not accommodate uncertainty in resources and variability in how individuals use resources. We provide hierarchical models for resource-growth responses that accommodate stochasticity in parameters and in data, despite the fact that causes are typically unknown. A complex joint posterior distribution taken over > 10(2) parameters is readily integrated to provide a comprehensive accounting of uncertainty in the growth response, together with a small number of hyperparameters that summarize the population response. An application involving seedling growth response to light availability shows that large trophic differences among species suggested by traditional models can be an artifact of the assumption that all individuals respond identically. The hierarchical analysis indicates broad trophic overlap. with the implication that slow dynamics play a more important role in preserving diversity than is widely believed.

AB Many attempts have been made to link invasions of exotic plants to specific plant traits and key attributes of invaded ecosystems. While these factors play a role in determining the potential for invasion. they are often inadequate in predicting the Success of a specific invasion. We show that interactions of an invasive grass with other members of the community determine the local pattern of invasion. A fungus, Ulocladium atrum, aids the establishment of barbed goatgrass (Aegilops triuncialis) by weakening the grass's tough seed head. thereby accelerating germination and seedling establishment. In contrast, gophers. Thomomys bottae, decrease establishment of this invader by selectively burying patches of goatgrass seedlings under mounds. Plants that survive these gopher disturbance produce seeds that are uninfected by Ulocladium atrum, which may further decrease the establishment of the next generation of goatgrass. A field survey indicated that goatgrass achieves dominance in areas with minimal gopher disturbance. but has limited establishment in pastures with high gopher activity, indicating that the landscape pattern of gopher activity influences patterns of goatgrass invasion by manipulating gopher-plant-fungal interactions.

AB Here we present a meta-analytic approach to analyzing Population interactions across the North Atlantic Ocean. We assembled all available biomass time series for a well-documented predator-prey couple, Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis), to test whither the temporal dynamics of these populations are consistent with the "top-down" or the "bottom-up" hypothesis. Eight out of nine regions showed inverse correlations of cod and shrimp biomass supporting the "top-down" view. Exceptions occurred only close to the southern range limits of both species, Random-effects meta-analysis showed that shrimp biomass was strongly negatively related to cod biomass, but not to Ocean temperature in the North Atlantic Ocean. In contrast, cod biomass was positively related to ocean temperature. The strength of the cod-shrimp relationship. however, declined with increasing mean temperature.
   These results show that changes in predator Populations can have strong effects on prey populations in oceanic food webs, and that the strength of these interactions may be sensitive to changes in mean ocean temperature. This means that the effects of overfishing in the ocean cascade down to lower trophic levels, as has been shown previously for lakes and coastal seas. In order to further investigate these processes, we establish a methodological framework to analyze species interactions from time series data.

AB The deleterious effects of inbreeding have been well documented, but only recently have studies begun to explore the consequences of inbreeding for important ecological interactions. We examined the effects of inbreeding on the interaction between host and pathogen using the mixed-mating Mimulus guttatus (Scrophulariaceae) and Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV). Inbred (self) and outbred M. guttatus from two California populations (M5 and M13) were rub-inoculated with CMV and compared to sham-inoculated controls. Flower production by outbred plants in host population M5 showed little effect of the inoculation treatment, but inoculation reduced flower production of inbred plants by 12%, indicating that inbreeding reduces tolerance to CMV infection. This interaction fell short of significance, however. The effects of inbreeding and CMV inoculation on biomass in M5 varied significantly across the 15 families used in this experiment, indicating genetic variation in the effect of inbreeding on resistance or tolerance to CMV. CMV infection reduced biomass in host population M13, but there were no significant interactions between virus treatment and level of inbreeding for either flower production or biomass. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect CMV in host tissues. In both populations, mean ELISA absorbance values of inoculated plants were nearly identical for self and outcross hosts, indicating equal susceptibility to CMV. In outbred plants of population M5, flower production did not change with increasing ELISA absorbance, but in inbred plants it declined, indicating reduced tolerance to CMV infection. The results from this study suggest that pathogens may become increasingly detrimental as host populations become more inbred.

AB Studies focusing on pairwise interactions between plants and herbivores may not give an accurate picture of the overall selective effect of herbivory, given that plants are often eaten by a diverse array of herbivore species. The outcome of such interactions may be further complicated by the effects of plant hybridization. Hybridization can lead to changes in morphological, phenological and chemical traits that could in turn alter plant-herbivore interactions. Here we present results from manipulative field experiments investigating the interactive effects of multiple herbivores and plant hybridization on the reproductive success of Ipomopsis aggregata formosissima X I. tenuituba. Results showed that ungulate herbivores alone had a net positive effect on plant relative fitness, increasing seed production approximately 2-fold. Caterpillars had no effect on plant relative fitness when acting alone, with caterpillar-attacked plants producing the same number of flowers, fruits and seeds as the uneaten controls. Caterpillars, however, significantly reduced flower production of ungulate browsed plants. Flower production in these plants, however, was still significantly greater ( approximately 1.7-fold greater) than uneaten controls, likely leading to an increase in reproductive success through the paternal component of fitness given that fruit and seed production was not significantly different from that of herbivore-free controls. Although results suggest that herbivore imposed selection is pairwise, ungulates likely have a large influence on the abundance of, and hence the amount of damage caused by, caterpillar herbivores. Thus, because of the ecological interactions between ungulates and caterpillars, selection on Ipomopsis may be diffuse rather than pairwise, assuming such interactions translate into differential effects on plant fitness as herbivore densities vary. Plant hybridization had no significant effect on patterns of ungulate or caterpillar herbivory; i.e., no significant interactions were detected between herbivory and plant hybridization for any of the fitness traits measured in this study nor did plant hybridization have any significant effect on host preference. These results may be due to patterns of introgression or the lack of species-specific differences between I. aggregata formosissima and I. tenuituba. Plant hybridization per se resulted in lowered reproductive success of white colored morphs due in part to the effects of pollination. Although it appears that there would be strong directional selection favoring darker flower colors due to the lower reproductive success of the white colored morphs in the short run, the natural distribution of hybrids suggest that over the long run selection either tends to average out or there are no fitness differences among morphs in most years due to the additive fitness effects of hawkmoth and hummingbird pollinators.

AB The objective of this study was to determine how increasing atmospheric CO2 change plant tissue quality in four native grassland grass species (Agrostis stolonifera, Anthoxanthum odoratum, Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) which are all larval food-plants of Coenonympha pamphilus (Lepidoptera, Satyridae). We assessed the effect of these changes on the performance and larval food-plant preference of C. pamphilus in a greenhouse experiment. Furthermore, we tested the interactive effects of elevated CO2 and soil nutritional availability in F. rubra and its effect an larval development of C. pamphilus. In general, elevated CO2 decreased leaf water concentration, nitrogen concentration and specific leaf area (SLA), while leaf starch concentration was increased in all grass species. A species-specific reaction to elevated CO2 was only found for foliar starch concentration. P. pratensis did not increase its starch concentration under elevated CO2 conditions, whereas the other three species did. Fertilisation, investigated only for F. rubra, increased leaf nitrogen concentration and amplified the CO2-induced decrease in leaf nitrogen. Development time of C. pamphilus was on the average prolonged by two days under elevated CO2 and the prolongation differed from 0.7 to 5.3 days among food-plant species. Pupal fresh weight differed marginally between CO2 treatments. Fertilisation of the larval food-plant F. rubra shortened development time by one day and significantly increased pupal and adult fresh weights. C. pamphilus larvae showed a clear food-plant preference among grass species at the age of 36 h or older. Additionally, a change of food-plant preference under elevated CO2 was found. Larvae at ambient CO2 preferred Agrostis stolonifera and F. rubra, while under elevated CO2 Anthoxanthum odoratum and P. pratensis were preferred. The present study demonstrates that larval development of C. pamphilus is affected by food-plant species and CO2 induced changes in foliar chemistry. Although we found some species-specific reactions to elevated CO2 for foliar chemistry, no such CO2 by species interaction was found for insect development. The change in food-plant preference of larvae under elevated CO2 implies potential changes in selection pressure for grass species and might therefore affect evolutionary processes.

AB Variations observed in parasite virulence and host resistance may be the outcome of coevolutionary processes. Recent theoretical developments have led to a 'geographic mosaic theory' of coevolution according to which there are some localities where reciprocal selection occurs (hot spots) and others where it is strongly reduced (cold spots). Studies of host-parasitoid systems back this up, revealing a geographical variation of traits subjected to antagonistic selection governed by variations in the strength of the ecological interactions. A more detailed analysis of the genetic basis of these geographic variations in a model system - the interaction between Drosophila melanogaster and its specific parasitoid Leptopilina boulardi-suggests that cold spots and hot spots are also driven by the amount of genetic variation available for the trait considered. Our approach, based on isolating reference strains, has been found to predict the result of sympatric interactions and it will be helpful in identifying the selective forces responsible for the coevolution. In this model, host resistance to a standardised reference strain is a weak predictor of the outcome of interactions in the field, and the main parameter accounting for the geographic variations is the number of host species available, with less parasitoid virulence towards D. melanogaster being found in areas displaying a more diversified host community.

AB The mechanisms by which variability in sea ice cover and its effects on the demography of the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba cascade to other ecosystem components such as apex predators remain poorly understood at all spatial and temporal scales, yet these interactions are essential for understanding causal links between climate change, ecosystem response and resource monitoring and management in the Southern Ocean. To address some of these issues, we examined the long-term foraging responses of Adelie penguins Pygoscelis adeliae near Palmer Station, western Antarctic Peninsula, in relation to ice-induced changes in krill recruitment and availability. Our results suggest that (1) there is a direct, causal relationship between variability in ice cover, krill recruitment, prey availability and predator foraging ecology, (2) regional patterns and trends detected in this study are consistent with similar observations in areas as far north as South Georgia, and (3) large-scale forcing associated with the Antarctic Circumpolar Wave may be governing ecological interactions between ice, krill and their predators in the western Antarctic Peninsula and Scotia Sea regions. Another implication of our analyses is that during the last 2 decades in particular, krill populations have been sustained by strong age classes that emerge episodically every 4 to 5 yr. This raises the possibility that cohort senescence has become an additional ecosystem stressor in an environment where ice conditions conducive to good krill recruitment are deteriorating due to climate warming. In exploring these interactions, our results suggest that at least 1 'senescence event' has already occurred in the western Antarctic Peninsula region, and it accounts for significant coherent decreases in krill abundance, predator populations and predator foraging and breeding performance. We propose that krill longevity should be incorporated into models that seek to identify and understand causal links between climate change, physical forcing and ecosystem response in the western Antarctic Peninsula region.

AB Transport to and retention of early-life history stages within the estuarine turbidity maximum (ETM) region may be an important component of recruitment success of the anadromous striped bass Morone saxatilis and the white perch M, americana. This hypothesis was evaluated with spatially resolved surveys of the physical and biological characteristics of the upper Chesapeake Bay estuary during 5 cruises, 3 in May 1998 and 2 in May 1999. Gradients in depth-specific patterns of larval abundance and zooplankton prey were evaluated with respect to salinity, temperature and total suspended solids (TSS). Although physical conditions in the upper estuary differed between cruises and years, the spatial patterns in distribution of larvae and potential prey were consistent and tracked changes in salt front and ETM locations. A statistical analysis suggested that location relative to the ETM explained a significant amount of variability in concentrations of eggs, yolk-sac larvae, and larval prey, and that prey concentrations accounted for a significant amount of variability in concentrations of feeding larvae. Transport to the ETM region probably occurs during the egg (striped bass) and yolk-sac larva (white perch) stages and results in retention of early-stage feeding larvae in a zone of high prey concentrations. Physical conditions in the ETM region differed markedly between a low freshwater-flow year (1999) and a high flow year (1998), and abundances of striped bass and white perch post-yolk-sac larvae were significantly lower in 1999. Recruitment variability was poorly correlated with spawning stock biomass, but spawner-recruitment models that incorporated spring freshwater discharge explained an additional 41 % (striped bass) and 30 % (white perch) of the variability in recruitment. Annual changes in freshwater flow could control larval survival and recruitment by modifying the physical and biological characteristics of the ETM region.

AB The influence of seasonal and ontogenetic changes on the dietary composition of 3 amphipod species (Synchelidium lenorostralum, S. trioostegitum and Gitanopsis japonica) were studied in the surf zone of a sandy shore habitat in Dolsando, southern Korea. The 2 species of Synchelidium were found to be carnivorous feeders, consuming mainly benthic harpacticoid copepods, whereas G. japonica had a diet consisting of both copepods and detritus. The dietary composition of S. lenorostralum and S. trioostegitum overlapped for all ontogenetic stages. Little overlap was found in the dietary composition of G. japonica compared with the 2 Synchelidium species, a characteristic that might favor the co-existence of the 3 species. S, lenorostralum displayed significant differences in dietary composition between sexes, among developmental stages, and over the seasonal cycle. For S. trioostegitum, dietary composition varied over the seasonal cycle. Juveniles of Synchelidium fed mainly on copepod nauplii and nematodes as well as on benthic harpacticoid copepods. Our results suggest that the biological interactions between benthic amphipods and meiofauna, such as benthic harpacticoid copepods and nematodes, may be important in the trophic chain of sandy shore surf zone habitats.

AB Hydroclimatic, biological and anthropogenic data-series (1915-1993) were analysed to determine and compare main trends and fish stock-environment relationships in the Black Sea. Long-term patterns were studied on different temporal scales: interdecadal, decadal and interannual variation. The results showed evidence of coherent patterns across different indices. Temperature, atmospheric pressure, wind and river run-off series were significantly correlated with most of the biological, anthropogenic and fish stock indices. Anthropogenic factors such as eutrophication and hypoxia were responsible for degradation of the coastal ecosystems, but they can also have negative impacts on open-sea populations. The correlations established allow formulation of hypotheses on the causal links between the abiotic environment, productive processes and population dynamics. The physical environment was recognised as being the main factor driving the biological productivity and essentially influencing all processes in the sea. Other factors responsible for a great part of the observed variability in marine data were biological interactions and anthropogenic impact. The rise in overall productivity after 1970 might be explained by several factors acting simultaneously: a favourable climatic regime, increased eutrophication, and the effect of trophic cascades attributable to overfishing of predators. The indices and relationships studied can be useful for integrating environmental information in fisheries and ecosystem management.

AB Biotic communities in highly variable, frequently perturbed habitats are usually expected to be structured mainly by abiotic factors. In the highly variable deep-sea hydrothermal vent environment, physical and chemical factors are known to play an important role in limiting the distribution and abundance of species, but the importance of biotic interactions remains largely unresolved. The high density and biomass attained by the vent macrofauna suggest that resource partitioning and competition may be significant in these communities. This study of food resource utilisation at northeast Pacific deep-sea hydrothermal vents uses an approach based on stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses to characterise trophic interactions between the 3 dominant alvinellid polychaetes, Paralvinella palmiformis, P. sulfincola, and P. pandorae. We also examine size structure in sympatric and allopatric populations of F palmiformis and P. pandorae. Results indicate that food resource partitioning occurs both intra- and interspecifically in P. palmiformis and P. sulfincola, and we advocate that this process contributes to explaining their co-existence at very high densities. In contrast, P. pandorae has a much more restricted trophic niche, overlaps P. palmiformis in diet and is much smaller in size when found in sympatry with P. palmiformis. P. pandorae is the most likely of the 3 species to be affected by intra- and/or interspecific competition for food, and this may explain the drastic change in the population size structure observed between successive years. Our work indicates that within the limits imposed by environmental conditions, biotic interactions such as food resource partitioning and competition can be significant factors structuring deep-sea hydrothermal vent communities.

AB Direct or plant-mediated interactions between herbivores may modify their spatial distribution among and within plants. In this study, we examined the effect of a leaf-chewing geometrid, the autumnal moth (Epirrita autumnata), on two different herbivore groups, leaf rolling Deporaus betulae weevils and Eriocrania spp. leafminers, both feeding on mountain birch (Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii). The exact locations of herbivores within tree canopies were mapped during three successive summers. In the first 2 years, some trees were artificially colonized by eggs of the autumnal moth to induce both rapid and delayed resistance in the foliage. The natural infection levels of the pathogenic rust fungus (Melampsoridium betulinum), potentially involved in species interactions, were also recorded. At the level of the whole tree, the density of D. betulae leaf rolls was lower in trees infested by the autumnal moth in the same year. However, the feeding locations within trees were partly segregated: D. betulae favoured shadier branches, while E. autumnata preferred the sunny parts of the canopy. The autumnal moth did not affect current- or following-year density of leafminers at the tree or branch level. Trees infected by rust had fewer leafminers in the same summer than noninfected trees. There were no interaction effects between defoliation by the autumnal moth and rust infection, and no delayed effects on the abundance of other herbivores the following year. Taken together, these findings suggest that the autumnal moth has a negative, partially plant-mediated impact on D. betulae, and can reduce the extent of current-year defoliation caused by D. betulae. This may be beneficial for the mountain birch, since the greater part of D. betulae damage occurs around or after the end of the larval period of the autumnal moth, which may be a critical time for tree recovery after moth outbreaks.

AB We conducted streamside experiments to determine if the ability of herbivorous insects to remove algal periphyton varies with local current velocity. We used two mayfly species (Baetis bicaudatus and Drunella grandis) and one caddisfly species (Glossosoma verdona), which differ from one another in body morphology and mobility. Periphyton was grown for 30 days on ceramic tiles in constant velocity to create similar initial forage conditions for grazers. Tiles were transferred to three velocity regimes characteristic of the natural streambed: slow (3-5 cm s(-1)), medium (15-20 cm s(-1)) and fast (3241 cm s(-1)). Four grazer treatments (Baetis, Drunella, and Glossosoma alone, and all species combined) were repeated for each velocity treatment to isolate the effect of local current on grazer ability to crop periphyton. Grazers differed in their abilities to remove periphyton across current treatments. Glossosoma removed significantly (P<0.05) more periphyton at fast versus either slow or medium velocities; Baetis showed a similar (but nonsignificant) trend; and, Drunella always removed about 75% of periphyton, irrespective of current. At fast current, periphyton removal was equivalent among the species. At medium current, Drunella removed significantly more than both Baetis and Glossosoma, whereas at slow current, Drunella removed more than Baetis, which removed more than Glossosoma. Periphyton removal under the combined three-grazer treatment was similar qualitatively to the combined effects of individual grazers. More periphyton tended to be removed as current increased, with the fast versus slow contrast showing marginal significance (P=0.10). Under all current regimes, the quantity of periphyton removed did not differ from the null model expectation of simple additive effects among individual grazers (i.e., no facilitation or inhibition). These experiments show that for some species, herbivory varies with current, which suggests that the herbivore "function" of cropping periphyton may vary with the environmental context of local current. Under some local velocities, however, different herbivore species "function" similarly and are potentially redundant with respect to periphytic removal. In naturally heterogeneous streams characterized by sharp gradients in local current velocity, we expect current-dependent species interactions to be common and at least partially contribute to intra-guild co-existence of species.

AB The inverse relationship between the particle size of food resources and earthworm growth rate is widely recognised. The aim was to determine the effects of the particle size of food on interactions between combinations of adult and hatchling A. chlorotica and L. terrestris under laboratory conditions. Treatments were set up in 1 litre mesocosms, maintained in darkness at 15 +/- 1 degreesC. Separated cattle solids (SCS) were used as food either unmilled or milled to < 1 mm. The latter led to a 185 and 54 % increase in the mass of A. chlorotica and L. terrestris respectively, compared with unmilled SCS. Intra-specific competition in A. chlorotica was detected in adult and hatchling pairings. A positive inter-specific interaction was recorded with hatchling A. chlorotica and mature L. terrestris fed unmilled SCS with growth of the former significantly greater (P < 0.01) than in conspecific monoculture. Clitellate A. chlorotica were only recorded in unmilled SCS treatments when paired with L. terrestris (week 18). In milled treatments, 100 % maturation was achieved in monoculture and in pairings with hatchling and mature L. terrestris by week 14. The final mass of initially hatchling L. terrestris (3.23 g) fed milled SCS in monoculture was significantly greater (P<0.01) than in pairings with hatchling A. chlorotica and mature conspecifics. With unmilled SCS, lowest initially hatchling L. terrestris mean mass (1.04 g) was recorded when paired with mature conspecifics. Growth of both species was significantly enhanced by decreased food particle size and this effect was size specific. The intensity of competitive interactions was influenced by food particle size and stage of earthworm development. Results suggested a positive association between the two species and mechanisms for this are proposed.

AB The anthropogenic impact on the Earth's ecosysterns are leading to dramatic changes in ecosystem functioning and even to destruction of them. System analysis and the use of heuristic modeling can be an effective means to determine the main biological interactions and key factors that are of high importance for understanding the development of ecosysterns. Cycling of limiting substances, induced by the external free energy flux, and trophic links interaction is the basis of the mathematical modeling studies presented in this paper. Mathematical models describe the dynamics of simplified ecosysterns having different characteristics:1) different degrees of biotic turnover closure (from open to completely closed); 2) different numbers of trophic links (including both "top-down", "bottom-up" regulation types); 3) different intensities of input - output flows of the limiting nutrient and its total amount in the system. Adaptive values of the changes of lower hierarchical levels (populational, trophic chain level) are to be estimated by integrity indices for total system functioning (e.g. NPP, total photosynthesis). The approach developed can be used for evaluating the contributions of lower hierarchical levels to the functioning of the higher hierarchical levels of the system. This approach may have value for determining biomanipulation management and their assessment. (C) 2003 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The accurate determination of nestling age and sex is an important tool for studies that examine life-history traits and ecological interactions. Despite the widespread distribution of the brown falcon, Falco berigora, in Australia, morphological criteria for sexing nestlings of this species have yet to be published and nestling development has not been intensively studied. While an ageing formula for the species exists, the small sample from which it was derived precluded appropriate statistical assessment of independence problems and other potentially confounding variables such as hatch order and sex. This study used a larger sample of free-living nestlings to account for these factors and found the most reliable measure for ageing nestlings to be wing length. Wing length increased linearly with chick age, independent of seven other potentially confounding factors examined. Ageing formulae based on wing length before and after remiges emerge are presented. In addition, an accurate test for determining nestling sex at banding age, based on tarsus width, is proposed. Nestling chronology of this species is also described in detail for the first time. Nestling development was similar to that described for other Falconiformes; however, the chronology of nestling development was too variable to be useful in assigning chick age. Despite this, within 6 days of the eldest chick hatching the relative brightness of down and the degree to which chicks' eyes had opened were useful in assigning hatch order amongst nestlings with similar wing lengths.

AB Four rules formulated in the ecological literature are explained by ecosystem theory, using models to represent the rules and the ecological interactions and processes. The rules are in all four cases in accordance with the principle that an ecosystem strives toward highest possible exergy at the prevailing conditions. The ecological literature should not publish just observations, correlations and rules should try in many cases to explain these observations, correlation and rules, because system ecology has provided a theoretical basis, which can be used to a much higher extent. Ecology does not need to remain a science based on empirical relationships, but is clearly to day a theoretical based science, which is able to explain the ecological observations by the application of basic laws.

AB The role of species interactions in structuring parasite communities remains controversial. Here, we show that interspecific competition between two avian malaria parasite species, Plasmodium gallinaceum and P. juxtanucleare, occurs as a result of interference during parasite fertilization within the bloodmeal of the mosquito. The significant reduction in the transmission success of P. gallinaceum to mosquitoes, due to the co-infecting P. juxtanucleare, is predicted to have compromised its colonization of regions occupied by P. juxtanucleare and, thus, may have contributed to the restricted global distribution of P. gallinaceum. Such interspecies interactions may occur between human malaria parasites and, thus, impact upon parasite species epidemiology, especially in regions of seasonal transmission.

AB In this study, we describe small-scale (6 cm-5 m) spatial patterns of four dominating infaunal taxa in the northern Baltic Sea, with the objective to construct hypotheses about pattern-generating processes. Two neighbouring sites, differing in their physical environment, were extensively sampled, and the distributions of adults and juveniles were analysed with spatial autocorrelograms. Relationships between taxa and size classes were studied with correlations at different scales. As similar spatial patterns and correlations appeared at both sites, this suggests that biotic interactions rather than physical factors were responsible for the patterns. We found that several taxa, exhibited patchy distributions at the studied scales. In the case of juvenile Monoporeia affinis (Amphipoda) and juvenile Corophium volutator (Amphipoda), we propose that positive intragroup interactions were responsible for the patterns. The correlation analyses suggested that areas with high densities of adult Macoma balthica (Bivalvia) were avoided by juvenile conspecifics and adults of M. affinis and C. volutator, probably because adult M balthica reduced the amount of detritus in the surficial sediment.

AB Concentration of atmospheric CO2 and temperature have both been rising for the last three decades. In this century, the temperature has been predicted to rise by 2-5degreesC and the CO2 concentration to double. These changes may affect the primary and secondary metabolism of plants and thus have implications for other trophic levels. However, the biotic interactions in changing climate conditions are poorly known.
   In this study, two questions were addressed: W How will climate change affect growth and the amounts of secondary compounds in flexible plant species? and 60 How will this affect herbivores living on this species. Four clones of the dark-leaved willow (Salix myrsinifolia (Salisb.)) seedlings were grown in closed-top chambers with two controlled factors: concentration of atmospheric CO2 and temperature (T). There were four combinations of these factors, each combination replicated four times (total of 16 chambers): (i) Control CO2 (350 ppm) and control T, (ii) Elevated CO2 (700 ppm) and control T, (iii) Control CO2 and elevated T (2degreesC), and (iv) Elevated CO2 and elevated T. Stem growth and aerial biomass of the plants were determined; and the leaf phenolics, nitrogen and water concentrations were analysed. In addition the growth rate of larvae and feeding preference of adults of a specialist herbivore, the chrysomelid beetle Phratora vitellinae (L.), on the treated willow leaves were measured.
   Elevated temperature and CO2 concentration increased the stem biomass and elevated CO2 increased leaf biomass and total aerial biomass of the willows. Patterns of biomass allocation were different in different temperature treatments. At elevated temperature there was less branch and leaf material in relation to stems than at the control temperature. Moreover, patterns of biomass allocation differed among clones. CO2 enhancement increased the specific leaf weight (SLW) and reduced both water and nitrogen content of the leaves, however, leaf area was unaffected by the treatments. Carbon dioxide (CO2) and T enhancement reduced the concentrations of several phenolic compounds in the leaves. Phenolic compounds, nutrients, and water in the leaves might be diluted partly due to increased carbon allocation to different structures (e.g. thickening of cell wall and increase of trichomes, etc.). In some cases plant clones showed specific responses to treatments.
   The CO2 enhancement reduced the relative growth rate (RGR) of the beetle larvae, and in contrast, temperature elevation increased it. Adult beetles did not clearly discriminate between willow leaves grown in different T and CO2 environments, but tended to eat more leaf material from chambers with doubled CO2 concentration. At elevated CO2 adult beetles may need to eat more leaf material in order to reproduce, which may in turn prolong the life cycles, increasing the risk of being eaten and possibly affecting ability to overwinter successfully. Overall, climate change may significantly modify the dynamic interaction between willow and beetle populations.

AB Fungal infection of Chinese cabbage leaves by Alternaria brassicae has earlier been shown to have detrimental effects on larval development of the chrysomelid beetle Phaedon cochleariae. Furthermore, adults of this leaf beetle avoid fungus-infected Chinese cabbage leaves for oviposition and feeding. However, herbivory had no impact on fungal growth. In this study, we investigated physiological responses of the host plant to herbivore attack and fungal infection in order to elucidate the mechanisms of the described ecological interactions between the fungus and the herbivore. Changes in primary factors (water, C/N ratio, protein, sucrose) and defense-related plant compounds (glucosinolates, anthocyanins, peroxidase) were measured. Herbivory and fungal infection reduced the sucrose concentration of leaves and increased amounts of indole glucosinolates as well as total anthocyanins. In addition, water content was slightly lower in insect-damaged but not in infected leaves. Higher levels of peroxidase activity resulted exclusively from fungal infection. The C/N ratio and total protein content remained unaffected by either treatment. The implications of the induced plant changes on the herbivore are discussed.

AB 1 The simultaneous use of fruits and seeds by invertebrate seed predators and vertebrate seed dispersers produces complex ecological interactions that reduce the predictability of seed fate.
   2 Cocosoid palm seeds in the Neotropics are subject to high mortality by bruchid beetle infestation and such attack is the major cause of mortality for seeds of the palm Attalea maripa at our study site in the northern Brazilian Amazon.
   3 The exocarp and mesocarp of 1400 fruits were manipulated in different ways to simulate handling by vertebrates. No eggs of the bruchid beetle, Pachymerus cardo, were laid on intact control fruits, while the highest numbers of eggs were received by fruits whose exocarp and mesocarp had been partially removed, as if by primates and rodents (mean of 15.9 and 18.9 eggs fruit(-1), respectively, during the peak fruiting season). Fruits with intact mesocarp but no exocarp, and fruits with all mesocarp and exocarp removed, received low numbers of eggs (mean of 4.6 and 6.6 eggs per fruit, respectively, during the peak fruiting season). Thus both exocarp and mesocarp deter oviposition, and removal of these fruit structures increases fruit susceptibility to infestation.
   4 Oviposition rates declined as the fruiting season progressed, but oviposition preferences remained the same. Seed mortality was high for any fruit on which eggs were laid.
   5 Large rodents and primates, which have been considered among the most effective seed dispersers for large-seeded Neotropical trees such as palms, actually increased the susceptibility of seeds to bruchid beetle attack. Removal of (intact) seeds by other dispersers may be necessary to ensure seed survival.
   6 These results indicate that the reliability of seed dispersers cannot be gauged without a complete understanding of variables that affect seed viability.

AB Interaction modifications arise when the presence of one species alters the behavior of a second thereby altering that species' interactions with a third. Species-specific phorid parasitoids that attack ants at food resources can modify the competitive interactions between their host and competing ant species. This study examines whether interaction modifications created during interactions between the phorid fly parasitoid. Apocephalus sp. 8, its host, Pheidole diversipilosa, and ant species with which P. diversipilosa competes determine P. diversipilosa's foraging success. We also explore how varying resource size affects the ability of P. diversipilosa to capture resources and if this factor changes the nature or magnitude of the interaction modifications. We find that conflict between the host ant and competitor species at resources greatly improves the ability of the parasitoid to locate its host. In addition, the presence of a parasitoid at a food resource strongly reduces the ability of the host ant to capture that food resource when competing with other ant species. A wide variety of competitor species benefit from these linked interaction modifications and do so in accordance with their abundance in the assemblage. Finally, the size of the food resource in dispute affects the ability of the host ant to capture the resource, but parasitism and resource size affect resource turnover independently. These results are relevant to understanding the importance of interaction modifications in determining structure of ant assemblages.

AB To control shrubs, which are increasing in dominance in wetlands worldwide, winter burning may be an important tool, especially from the perspective of minimizing urban hazards. The goal of this project was to determine if winter burning was successful in reducing the dominance (mean percentage cover and maximum height) of Cornus sericea in sedge meadows in southern Wisconsin, where shrubs proliferated after cattle were excluded. Experimental burn and control plots were set up within sedge meadows, including an ungrazed "reference" site that had been little, if ever, grazed and a "historically grazed" site, a recovery site that had not been grazed by cattle since 1973. None of the dominant species including C. sericea was significantly affected by burning for either mean percentage cover or maximum height (analysis of variance: no burning x species interaction). Both mean percentage cover and maximum height were only weakly related to burning (28.1 and 14.3% of the variability contributed to the cumulative percentage of the coefficient of determination, respectively) at both sites based on non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis. Although species richness increased in burned plots in 1999 and 2000, no differences were apparent between pre-burned and unburned plots in 1997 and unburned plots in 1999 and 2000 (analysis of variance: year x burning interaction). After burning in the ungrazed site, herbaceous species appeared that had not been detected for decades, including Chelone glabra and Lathyrus palustris. Exotic species were present in both the ungrazed reference and recovery site. Although winter burning treatments did not reduce the dominance of woody shrub species in the site recovering from cattle grazing, burning was useful in stimulating the maintenance of species richness in the ungrazed sedge meadow.

AB We investigated predation risk and competition as they affected small-mammal foraging behavior in semiarid north-central Chile. Giving-up densities (GUD) of seeds were used to measure the foraging activity of the three most common small mammals at the site: degu (Octodon degus), Darwin's leaf-eared mouse (Phyllotis darwini), and the olivaceous field mouse (Akodon olivaceus), under shrubs (cover) and in the open on predator-excluded and competitor-excluded (Octodon) plots. Experiments were conducted during both new and full moons. Monthly small-mammal censuses using standard mark-recapture techniques provided data on movement, reproduction, and long-term fluctuations in density between 1989 and 1994. Diurnal Octodon foraged more (had lower GUD-) in the absence of predators (although this was confounded by a numerical, increase resulting from predator exclusion), and foraged more under shrubs than, in the open. However, the lack of a significant cover x predator exclusion interaction and thermoregulation studies suggest that physiological constraints play,a greater role than predation risk in determining micro-habitat selection by Octodon. Predation risk, as influenced by lunar light levels and predator exclusion, had only weak effects on micro-habitat selection by Phyllotis. The strong tendency of Octodon to forage under cover could depress food availability, forcing Phyllotis to feed more in the open. Concomitantly, Phyllotis exhibits several morphological characters that would favor detection and avoidance of predators. There is extensive evidence that interspecific competition is the primary constraint on Akodon foraging; predation risk appears to be relatively unimportant. Akodon is also a less efficient forager than the two other species, having significantly higher GUD, on average. This is partially offset by differences in reproductive biology; Akodon exhibits extremely rapid. demographic responses to favorable changes in the environment. A fourth species, Abrothrix longipilis, may coexist in the system because of its opportunistic nature, but no data are available on its foraging efficiency. These behavioral and biotic interactions occur within a background of periodic El Nino-Southern Oscillations (ENSO), which may ultimately contribute to species coexistence.

AB Ecological interactions among invading species are common and may often be important in facilitating invasions. Indeed, the presence of one nonindigenous species can act as an agent of disturbance that facilitates the invasion of a second species. However, most studies of nonindigenous species are anecdotal and do not provide substantive evidence that interactions among nonindigenous species have any community-level effects. Here, using a combination of field experiments and observations we examine interactions among introduced species in New England kelp forests and ask whether these interactions have altered paradigms describing subtidal communities in the Gulf of Maine. The green alga Codium fragile was observed at the Isles of Shoals, Maine, USA, in 1983 and has since replaced the native kelp as the dominant seaweed on leeward shores. Experiments manipulating kelp and Codium reveal that Codium does not directly inhibit growth or survival of kelp. Codium does, however, successfully recruit to gaps in the kelp bed and, once established, inhibits recruitment of kelp. A second nonindigenous species, Membranipora membranacea, grows epiphytically on kelp, and experiments reveal that the presence of Membranipora reduces growth and survival of kelp, resulting in defoliation of kelp plants and gap formation in kelp beds. In the absence of Codium, kelp recolonizes these gaps, but when present, Codium colonizes and prevents kelp recolonization. Manipulations of herbivores demonstrate that herbivory will reinforce Codium dominance. Thus, the demise of New England kelp beds appears to result from one invasive species facilitating the spread of a second nonindigenous species.

AB In plant communities, the portfolio effect, also called "statistical averaging effect", expresses the fact that stability in aggregate community properties such as biomass productivity generally rises with species diversity, simply because of the statistical averaging of the fluctuations in species' properties. This paper essentially upgrades the previous formulations of the portfolio effect, first developed by Doak and collaborators and then by Tilman. It uses a theoretical approach based on simple statistical relationships and some simplifying assumptions proposed by these authors. The new formulation presented extends and improves the previous relationships in the sense that it takes into account simultaneously a varying scaling power of the variance, the interaction effect between species, the heterogeneity in species productivity and interspecies correlated responses to the environment. It appears that the simple statistical averaging, as inferred from this formulation, does not necessarily lead to a positive correlation between species diversity and community stability.

AB The spatial relationships exhibited by individuals in a population may indicate their social organization. In territorial species interactions between individuals should lead to maximal spacing in a uniform pattern. Using nearest neighbor distances (NND), I tested for territoriality in the green frog (Rana clamitans) by determining if males were uniformly dispersed within breeding choruses. Observed dispersion patterns were not consistent with territoriality. Males were randomly dispersed on all seven nights during the breeding period, four of five nights during the nonbreeding period and uniformly dispersed on one night during the nonbreeding period. Dispersion did not differ between periods although density was higher and NND was smaller during the breeding period. There was also no correlation between male size and NND. The disparity of my results might be explained by differences in male density and resource distribution and its effect on habitat quality since these factors influence behavior and spacing. Alternatively, uniform spacing may not be a reliable characteristic of territoriality.

AB Although habitat loss, fragmentation, and invasive species collectively pose the greatest threats to biodiversity, little theoretical or empirical research has addressed the effects of landscape structure-or spatial pattern more generally-on the spread of invasive species. Landscape ecology is the study of how spatial pattern affects ecological process. Thus, a landscape ecology of invasive spread involves understanding how spatial pattern, such as habitat fragmentation or resource distributions, affects the various stages of the invasion process. Landscape structure may affect the spread of invasive species and the invasibility of communities by (1) enhancing spread above some threshold level of landscape disturbance directly, or indirectly through landscape effects on dispersal vectors; (2) affecting the various stages of the invasion process (e.g., dispersal vs. population growth) in different, potentially contrasting, ways; (3) interacting with the distribution of invasive species to facilitate spread (e.g., nascent foci); (4) promoting or altering species interactions in ways that enhance the invasibility of communities (e.g., edge effects); (5) compromising the adaptive potential of native species to resist invasion, or-alternatively-enhancing the adaptive response of invasive species, in fragmented landscapes; and (6) interacting with the dynamics of the disturbance architecture to create spatiotemporal fluctuations in resource availability, which enhance system invasibility. Understanding the landscape ecology of invasive spread may thus afford new insights and opportunities for managing and restoring landscapes so as to control the spread of invasive species and minimize the invasibility of communities.

AB The "geographic mosaic" approach to understanding coevolution is predicated on the existence of variable selection across the landscape of an interaction between species. A range of ecological factors, from differences in resource availability to differences in community composition, can generate such a mosaic of selection among populations, and thereby differences in the strength of coevolution. The result is a mixture of hotspots, where reciprocal selection is strong, and coldspots, where reciprocal selection is weak or absent, throughout the ranges of species. Population subdivision further provides the opportunity for nonadaptive forces, including gene flow, drift, and metapopulation dynamics, to influence the coevolutionary interaction between species. Some predicted results of this geographic mosaic of coevolution include maladapted or mismatched phenotypes, maintenance of high levels of polymorphism, and prevention of stable equilibrium trait combinations.
   To evaluate the potential for the geographic mosaic to influence predator-prey coevolution, we investigated the geographic pattern of genetically determined TTX resistance in the garter snake Thamnophis sirtalis over much of the range of its ecological interaction with toxic newts of genus Taricha. We assayed TTX resistance in over 2900 garter snakes representing 333 families from 40 populations throughout western North America. Our results provide dramatic evidence that geographic structure is an important component in coevolutionary interactions between predators and prey. Resistance levels vary substantially (over three orders of magnitude) among populations and over short distances. The spatial array of variation is consistent with two areas of intense evolutionary response by predators ("hotspots") surrounded by clines of decreasing resistance. Some general predictions of the geographic mosaic process are supported, including clinal variation in phenotypes, polymorphism in some populations, and divergent outcomes of the interaction between predator and prey. Conversely, our data provide little support for one of the major predictions, mismatched values of interacting traits. Two lines of evidence suggest selection is paramount in determining population variation in resistance. First, phylogenetic information indicates that two hotspots of TTX resistance have evolved independently. Second, in the one region that TTX levels in prey have been quantified, resistance and toxicity levels match almost perfectly over a wide phenotypic and geographic range. However, these results do not preclude the role the nonadaptive forces in generating the overall geographic mosaic of TTX resistance. Much work remains to fill in the geographic pattern of variation among prey populations and, just as importantly, to explore the variation in the ecology of the interaction that occurs within populations.

AB A central challenge for those Studying organism distributions is to identify the relevant scale at which a distribution is established and the relevant mechanism driving the maintenance of the pattern. Melanoplus femurrubrum grasshoppers in NE Connecticut are missing from grass dominated fields. I examined two hypotheses about why the grasshopper is missing from these types of fields in this region. The first hypothesis was that behavioural responses to predation and competition prevent establishment by limiting above ground stages of the grasshopper. The second hypothesis was that soil temperature and grass habitat characteristics influence oviposition, behaviour and limit egg development. Testing among these different hypotheses (trophic vs abiotic), data from experiments and field observations indicated that while the within field distribution of M. femurrubrum can be sensitive to the effects of trophic interactions during the above ground phase of the life-cycle, the among field distribution is limited by female oviposition choice, limited heating degree-days for egg development, and poor resource conditions for. the first instar grasshoppers. These results highlight the need to examine behaviour and community interactions across habitats and life stages in studies of distribution patterns.

AB In patches of co-occurring species in natural plant communities, there is a finely poised balance between species in the ways in which they respond to prevailing moisture and temperature regimes. However, environmental change scenarios, in which temperature, moisture and ultraviolet-B radiation are suggested to increase, may favour one of the species. The imbalance is likely to occur at the levels of interactions between patches of the different species and at the shoot level when neighbouring shoots belong to different species. We increased temperature and UV-B in a two-way factorial experiment and increased water supply independently in two subarctic mire communities dominated by the mosses Sphagnum fuscum and Dicranum elongatum. The effects of simulated increase in UV-B were Studied using two separate radiation systems, i.e. a "square wave" system and a "modulated" system.
   When precipitation was enhanced, both species showed an increase in growth but this was not sustained beyond 5 mm per day. S.fuscum showed a 50% greater response to enhanced precipitation than did D. elongatum, as would be expected from their habitat preferences. Under ambient temperature, S.fuscum grew 67% faster than D. elongatum and this relative difference in response was maintained after one year under a temperature enhancement. The response by species over the winter period was moderated by their neighbours. S.fuscum growth was enhanced when it grew next to D. elongatum whereas D. elongatum grew better with neighbours of its own species. Increased temperature and UV-B radiation did not affect the interaction between the species.
   Although a balance was maintained between the two species over the short duration of the experiment, potential was shown for all imbalance to occur over longer periods and particularly if winter warming and precipitation Lire greater than those in summer.
   During the peak growing season 20% increased UV-B over ambient had a negative effect oil S. fuscum under increased temperature but there were no overall seasonal effects on either species, irrespective of method of UV supplementation.

AB The existence of biotic interactions among macroinfauna resident on exposed sandy beaches and the potential roles that such interactions might play with respect to structuring these assemblages is currently a controversial topic. To elucidate the relative importance of biotic versus abiotic factors in determining the spatial distribution of beach fauna, we use a generalized additive model, which can account for nonlinear relationships between beach clam recruitment and four explanatory variables: two abiotic (beach gradient and distance from a major river mouth); and two biotic (the abundance of adult clams and the abundance of their juveniles). The study organism, Donax serra Roding, is a fairly typical intertidal filter feeder that dominates the macrofaunal communities on many southern African sandy beaches. Results indicate that a mixture of biotic and abiotic factors mediates recruit abundance, with beach gradient being the most influential, followed by adult and juvenile abundances. Of particular importance was strong evidence of intraspecific interactions between D. serra adults and recruits. Furthermore, despite the existence of a published hypothesis stating that the highest recruitment of this species is found beside river mouths and that the subsequent alongshore distribution of older age classes is determined primarily by distance from a major river mouth, we found the opposite. Lowest recruit abundance was in the vicinity of a river mouth and maximum recruit abundance was near the center of the beach. Distance from the river mouth was also less important in structuring the distribution of recruits than the biotic factors. This emphasizes the complex ecology of organisms inhabiting apparently simple intertidal landscapes, and illustrates how the generalized additive modelling approach can be fruitfully applied to problems in beach ecology.

AB Stratospheric ozone depletion caused by the release of chlorofluorocarbons is most pronounced at high latitudes, especially in the Southern Hemisphere (including the so-called 'ozone hole'). The consequent increase in solar ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B, 280-315 nm) reaching the earth's surface may cause a variety of alterations in terrestrial ecosystems. Most effects might be expected to occur above-ground since sunlight does not penetrate effectively below-ground. Here, we demonstrate that solar UV-B radiation in a fen in Tierra del Fuego (Argentina), where the ozone hole passes overhead several times during the Austral spring, is causing large changes of below-ground processes of this ecosystem. During the third and fourth year of a manipulative field experiment, we investigated root systems in these plots and found that when the ambient solar UV-B radiation was substantially reduced, there was a 30% increase in summer root length production and as much as a threefold decrease in already low symbiotic mycorrhizal colonization frequency of the roots compared with plots receiving near-ambient solar UV-B. There was also an apparent shift toward older age classes of roots under reduced solar UV-B. Such large changes in root system behaviour may have decided effects on competition and other ecological interactions in this ecosystem.

AB Taxon cycles are sequential phases of expansion and contraction of the ranges of species, associated generally with shifts in ecological distribution. The important contribution of the taxon cycle to biogeographical analysis is its emphasis on evolutionary and ecological interactions among colonizing and resident species, which influence their extinction dynamics and establish patterns of geographical distribution. Taxon cycles were inferred originally from the distribution of species across island archipelagos, where a correlation was noted between gaps in island occupancy and the degree of phenotypic differentiation. This pattern implied that phases of colonization were followed by range contraction, while endemic Antillean species that were undifferentiated between islands suggested secondary expansion and the beginning of a new cycle. This interpretation was met with scepticism, but reconstruction of phylogenetic relationships from gene sequences has now permitted us to characterize taxon cycles in Lesser Antillean birds. The relative timing of phases of the cycle can be deduced from genetic divergence between island populations. We have found that taxon cycles have periods in the order of 10(6) years and that cycles in different lineages occur independently of each other and independently of Pleistocene climate cycles. Individual island populations may persist for several millions of years on the larger islands of the Lesser Antilles; occasional expansion phases lead to the replacement of island populations that have disappeared, thus reducing the archipelago-wide rate of extinction to nil. What drives taxon cycles is unknown, but we speculate that they may be caused by co-evolution with enemy populations, and a probable mechanism would involve infrequent mutations influencing parasite virulence and avian host disease resistance. Taxon cycles undoubtedly occur on continents, but the geographical configuration of island archipelagos reveals more clearly their presence and invites their study.

AB 1. Metapopulation dynamics have been postulated as a possible mechanism giving rise to positive interspecific relationships between local abundance and regional occupancy. These may operate through the carrying capacity or the rescue effect hypotheses. However, both are based on single species models that sum independent occurrences of species to form an assemblage, ignoring interspecific interactions.
   2. Here we test experimentally whether interspecific interactions and dispersal influence the formation of the abundance-occupancy relationship in metapopulation systems in laboratory microcosms containing protists and bacteria.
   3. The effect of species interactions was tested by comparison of the abundance-occupancy relationship in multiple habitat patch systems containing all species together, with the relationship formed by combining data from equivalent systems containing each protist species alone
   4. Abundance-occupancy relationships in interacting communities were better defined than those in non-interacting communities. The inclusion of interspecific interactions was found to cause a reduction in the abundance and occupancy of the majority of species, as a consequence of which the position of species within the relationship changed drastically.

AB Heterogeneity of species interactions in food webs can result from characteristics of substrates as well as attributes of top consumers. We performed a streamside channel experiment to evaluate the impact of crayfish on lower trophic levels in detritus-based (leaf packs) and algal-based food webs (hard-bottoms). After 43 days, both male and female crayfish had dramatically promoted leaf decomposition, with males processin material at a faster rate. However, the difference in leaf processing rates was not related to a greater level of male activity. Despite the sex-related difference in residual leaf dry mass, densities of invertebrates in leaf packs were similarly low in the presence of crayfish of either sex, due to resource consumption, physical dislodgment (bioturbation) and/or predation. No trophic cascade was evident in the leaf pack assemblage. In the hard-bottom assemblage, the results confirmed circumstantial field evidence that crayfish reduce predatory Tanypodinae and indirectly increase collector-gatherer Chironominae following the prediction of a trophic cascade. However, no other taxa were indirectly facilitated, because of strong direct effects of crayfish on algal abundance (through direct consumption and bioturbation). Overall, impacts of crayfish on lower trophic levels were more pronounced in the structurally complex, detritus-based assemblages than in its hard-bottom, algal-based counterpart. This conflicts with the expectation that net predation effects should be weaker where structural complexity is greater but is mainly a consequence of the profound engineering effects of crayfish in reducing colonisable substrate when they shred and disturb detrital material. Effects of crayfish may therefore propagate differently and with varying strength depending on substrate. Moreover, engineering activities and predation by crayfish appear to have been of overwhelming significance with subtle sex differences in leaf processing rates failing to lead to differences in invertebrate densities.

AB Living fossils are taxonomic groups surviving for a long time without any remarkable morphological change. Most of them retain low taxonomic diversities. Although some of them have survived in refuges to avoid predators and competitors, not all living fossils live in refuges. The survival of these groups, therefore, should be discussed in the context of biological interaction. I carried out computer simulations of a model food web system, in which each species feeds on others according to its feeding preference. The system evolves via evolution of species. In the simulation, some clades, like "living fossils," survived for a long time with low species diversities. Such clades consisted of species with low evolutionary rates, which result in high predation pressure and intraclade competition for food. Nevertheless, the clades sustainably utilize prey clades and are consequently provided with sufficient food. In addition, because of the low species diversities of the clades, predators of the clades soon become extinct through lack of food. This study strongly suggests that in an evolving food web system, the low evolutionary rates of living fossils allow the long survival of those groups with low taxonomic diversities.

AB This study explores early vegetation development on pumice at Mount St. Helens. We monitored species annually in a grid of 200 contiguous 100-m(2) plots between 1989 and 1999. Of interest were how vegetation changed and if it became more homogeneous over time. Species richness and cover increased annually. Diversity (H') stabilized by 1996 and began to decline as long-lived stress-tolerant species such as Agrostis pallens, Carex mertensii and Penstemon cardwellii began to dominate. Protected sites had more species and higher cover than did exposed ones. Plots next to relict vegetation had more species and cover than did distant plots. The vegetation initially was dominated by species with good dispersal, but subsequently those with poor dispersal became dominant. We compared species expansion patterns to a model based on random colonization. The results implied that populations with poor dispersal derived from a few colonists that then produced seeds for local expansion. Detrended correspondence analysis showed a pronounced shift in species composition. This analysis also showed that species composition was becoming more homogeneous over time. However, significant heterogeneity remained and some plots are diverging from others. As yet, this vegetation is not developing towards a regional vegetation type. Rather, an unusual community with Agrostis spp., Carex spp., Penstemon cardwellii, Lupinus lepidus, Anaphalis margaritacea and Salix commutata has developed. The accumulation phase of primary succession is nearly complete. The next phase, in which vertical structure develops as Salix and conifers mature, has scarcely begun. It should be marked by the invasion of forest understory species and loss of subalpine meadow species. Assembly rules based on biotic interactions may then become evident.

AB The coexistence of species sharing mutual resources is usually thought to be limited by negative processes such as interspecific competition. This is because an overlap in resource use leads to negative fitness consequences, and traits favouring avoidance of potential competitors, for example in habitat selection, are therefore selected for. However, species interactions are acknowledged to vary from negative (competition) to mutualism, although empirical evidence for positive interspecific interactions from natural communities of other than plants and sessile animals is scarce. Here, we experimentally examined the habitat selection and its fitness consequences of a migrant bird, the pied flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca), in relation to the presence of competitively superior birds, resident titmice (Pants spp.). Experiments were conducted on two spatial scales: landscape and nest-site scale. We demonstrate that pied flycatchers were attracted to and accrued fitness benefits from the presence of titmice. Flycatchers breeding in tight association with titmice initiated breeding earlier, had larger broods and heavier young than solitarily breeding flycatchers. This paradoxical result indicates that species interactions may switch from negative to positive and that the coexistence of species is not always restricted by negative costs caused by other species.

AB The structure and dynamics of natural communities result from the interplay of abiotic and biotic factors. We. used manipulative field experiments to determine the relative roles of abiotic conditions and biotic interactions in structuring deep-sea (2500 m depth) communities along environmental gradients around hydrothermal vents of the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean (East Pacific Rise, at 9degrees50' N). We tested (1) whether predation by crabs and fishes affects the recruitment of benthic species and subsequent community structure and (2) whether the effects of predation vary along the steep gradients of temperature, oxygen, sulfide, and metal concentrations near vents. Recruitment substrates (basalt cubic blocks, roughly 10 cm on a side), both uncaged and caged to exclude predators (crabs, fishes, whelks, and octopi), were deployed along a decreasing vent fluid-flux gradient. The exclusion of predators for 8 mo increased the abundance of small mobile gastropods and amphipod crustaceans but decreased the abundance of sessile invertebrates, including juvenile vestimentiferan worms, tubiculous polychaetes, and mussels. Effects of predation were strongest nearest to hydrothermal vents, where abiotic environmental conditions were most extreme but productivity and the overall abundances of benthic invertebrates and mobile predators were the greatest. Additional 5-mo experiments conducted at three different locations showed similar trends at all sites, indicating that these effects of predation on benthic community structure are repeatable. Stomach-content analyses of the most abundant predators found at vents indicated that the zoarcid fish (Thermarces cerberus) primarily feeds on the vent snail Cyathermia naticoides, the limpet Lepetodrilus elevatus, and the amphipod crustacean Ventiella sulfuris, the very species that showed the greatest increase following predator exclusion. In contrast, brachyuran (Bythograea thermydron) and galatheid (Munidopsis subsquamosa) crab stomachs did not contain small mobile grazers, and crabs presented with arrays of the most common vent invertebrate species preferred mussels and vestimentiferans over limpets. Our results indicate that predation by large mobile predators influences the structure of hydrothermal vent communities, directly by reducing the abundance of gastropod prey species, and indirectly by reducing gastropod grazing and by bulldozing of recruits of sessile invertebrates.

AB J. M. Diamond's assembly rules model predicts that competitive interactions between species lead to nonrandom co-occurrence patterns. We conducted a meta-analysis of 96 published presence-absence matrices and used a realistic "null model" to generate patterns expected in the absence of species interactions. Published matrices were highly nonrandom and matched the predictions of Diamond's model: there were fewer species combinations, more checkerboard species pairs, and less co-occurrence in real matrices than expected by chance. Moreover, nonrandom structure was greater in homeotherm vs. poikilotherm matrices. Although these analyses do not confirm the mechanisms of Diamond's controversial assembly rules model, they do establish that observed co-occurrence in most natural communities is usually less than expected by chance. These results contrast with previous analyses of species co-occurrence patterns and bridge the apparent gap between experimental and correlative studies in community ecology.

AB The outcome of interspecific competition may be modulated by a large number of factors, both biotic and abiotic. In this paper, we examined experimentally the effects of geographic variation, population density, and abiotic stress on the outcome of interspecitic competition between two species of larval anurans. Three different populations of natteijack toad (Bufo calamita) were set to compete with common toad (Bufo bufo) in replicated artificial ponds under different combinations of osmotic stress (freshwater or brackish water) and intraspecific density (high and low). Among the B. calamita populations used, only one of them is sympatric to B. bufo and inhabits a freshwater environment. The two other populations, allopatric to B. bufo, occupy freshwater and brackish water environments, respectively. Survival, length of the larval period, and size at metamorphosis were analyzed at both the specific and the Populational interaction levels. Intra- and interspecific competition did occur and generally resulted in a decrease in survival rates, all increase in the duration of the larval period, and a decrease in size at metamorphosis. Water salinity also prolonged the larval period and interacted with intra- and interspecitic density, intensifying its effects. Interspecific competition was asymmetric, since B. bufo was competitively superior to B. calamita, causing larger effects on B. calamita than those experienced by B. bufo. However, the three populations of B. calamita showed different competitive effects and responses when they were set to compete with B. bufo. The population sympatric to B. bufo had the stronger competitive effect and response, causing a strong impact on survival, growth, and developmental rate of B. bufo). The allopatric population inhabiting the brackish environment also had a marked effect on B. bufo survival, although only at high density. The other allopatric population only had a significant effect on the size at metamorphosis of B. bufo). The impact of B. bufo on B. calamita was greater for the allopatric populations than for the sympatric one. This pattern suggests that the nature and outcome of ecological interactions are a function of environmental conditions and population history.

AB We investigated factors that define boundaries between assemblages of streamside and terrestrial plethodonfid salamanders by manipulating the moisture gradient in the ecotone between headwater streams and upland forests in the Allegheny Mountains of Virginia. Two experiments tested the hypothesis that microhabitat distributions of species change in response to competitors whose distributions are controlled by variation across the landscape at a larger scale.
   In the first experiment we created replicated seeps (continuously moist patches) 3 m and 15 m from streams. Desmognathus fuscus, a streamside species, be.-an to increase in density at streamside seeps and to colonize distant seeps within 1.5 mo of their construction. Plethodon cinereus, a small terrestrial species, initially responded favorably to distant seeps but was displaced as seeps were colonized by streamside species. The D. fuscus colonists remained on distant plots with seeps 22 mo after water to seeps was turned off and the habitat had returned to pretreatment conditions. On streamside plots P. cinereus occurred at low densities initially and was quickly displaced by D. fuscus from portions of the plots near seeps. Gyrinophilus porphyriticus, a large streamside species, and Plethodon glutinosus, a large terrestrial species, were less abundant but exhibited responses that were similar to those of D. fuscus and P. cinereus, respectively.
   In the second experiment we created seeps in upland forests > 30 in from the nearest stream or natural seep, more than twice as far front a source of colonists as the distant seeps in the first experiment. The creation of seeps was crossed with the addition of logs and rocks as cover objects in a replicated factorial design. Plethodon cinereus became more abundant and had greater mass adjusted for body size on plots with seeps than on control plots. Abundance of P. cinereus also increased with the addition of cover objects. Plethodon glutinosus was on affected by the seeps. Streamside salamanders were rare or absent on all plots.
   These experiments demonstrate that the response of a species to an environmental perturbation can depend on the spatial context and presence of competitors or predators, and that the response may persist much longer than the perturbation itself.

AB Coevolution is increasingly recognized as an important process structuring geographic variation in the form of selection for many populations. Here we consider the importance of a geographic mosaic of coevolution to pattern, of crossbill (Loxia) diversity in the northern boreal forests of North America. We examine the relationships between geographic variation in cone morphology, bill morphology, and feeding performance to test the hypothesis that, in the absence of red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus), black spruce (Picea mariana) has lost seed defenses directed at Tamiasciurus and that red crossbills (L. curvirostra) and black spruce have coevolved in an evolutionary arms race. Comparisons of cone morphology and several indirect lines of evidence suggest that black spruce has evolved defenses in response to Tamiasciurus on mainland North America but has lost these defenses on Newfoundland. Cone traits that deter crossbills, including thicker scales that require larger forces to separate, are elevated in black spruce on Newfoundland, and larger billed crossbills have higher feeding performances than smaller billed crossbills on black spruce cones from Newfoundland. These results imply that the large bill of the Newfoundland crossbill (L. c. perena) evolved as an adaptation to the elevated cone defenses on Newfoundland and that crossbills and black spruce coevolved in an evolutionary arms race on Newfoundland during the last 9000 years since glaciers retreated. On the mainland where black spruce is not as well defended against crossbills, the small-billed white-winged crossbill (L. leucoptera leucoptera) is more efficient and specializes on seeds in the partially closed cones. Finally, reciprocal adaptations between crossbills and conifers are replicated in black spruce and Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta ssp. latifolia), with coevolution most pronounced in isolated populations where Tamiasciurus are absent as a competitor. This study further supports the role of Tamiasciurus in determining the selection mosaic for crossbills and suggests that a,geographic mosaic of coevolution has been a prominent factor underlying the diversification of North American crossbills.

AB 1. Few detailed long-term data sets exist for fresh waters with which to examine large-scale temporal changes in community composition. Consequently, insight into community persistence has been restricted to a few, contingent case studies. We collated and analysed data for the aquatic macroinvertebrate community of Broadstone Stream in south-east England, spanning three decades. The pH of this naturally acid stream has risen progressively since the 1970s, and we sought to examine the potential effects of this environmental change upon the community.
   2. Persistence within Broadstone was high when compared with other systems that have been analysed using similar methods. The stream was characterised by a `core' community of eight taxa that were always present, and contributed 75-97% of total invertebrate abundance, with a trailing limb of progressively rarer and more acid-sensitive taxa. There was little species turnover, although the time-series exceeded 20 generations for most species.
   3. Despite this high persistence, a long-term response to rising pH was detected: species indicating profound acidity (identified a priori from independent studies) have declined since the 1970s, whereas indicators of moderate acidity increased. The structure of the community food web has also changed since the 1970s, with increased predator diversity and abundance, and a lengthening of food chains following the invasion of a new top predator.
   4. These changes in the community appeared to be driven by an interaction between pH and climate. The unusually hot, dry summers characteristic of the 1990s may have raised pH during the more sensitive (i.e. early) stages of the life-cycle, and thus provided a window of opportunity for less acid-tolerant taxa to colonise and become established. Changes in pH appeared to set the boundaries of the available local species pool, within which biotic interactions ultimately shaped the community.

AB 1. The abundance, production and control of pelagic heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF) in the Lower River Rhine (Germany) were investigated. Field samples (live-counting technique) were taken at least every 2 weeks at Cologne (km 685) over a period of 20 months. In addition, Lagrangian sampling was carried out 160 km downstream of Cologne (Kalkar-Grieth, km 845) over a period of 12 months. Potential HNF growth rates and loss rates caused by planktonic predators were estimated in the laboratory (size fractionation experiments) and compared with the changes in HNF-density in a water parcel flowing downstream.
   2. Mean abundance (+/-SD) ranged from 7 +/- 6 to 4890 +/- 560 individuals mL(-1) and was positively correlated with discharge. Heterotrophic nanoflagellates abundance increased up to 30-fold during flood events, whereas there were only minor changes in the taxonomic composition.
   3. HNF growth rate ranged from 0.16 +/- 0.12 to 1.98 +/- 0.10 day(-1). Between 0 and 95% (mean: 32%) of the gross production was lost to planktonic predators; a larger portion between 0 and 195% (mean: 64%) of the HNF gross production was lost by other means.
   4. There may be an important role for benthic predators in the control of pelagic HNF. First, production of HNF was high and grazing losses to planktonic predators low at times when HNF abundance was low. Secondly, high in situ loss rates (not explicable by planktonic predators), which were positively related to temperature, indicate the importance of biotic interactions. Thirdly, the dependence of HNF abundance on discharge indicated a decrease grazing intensity with rising water levels (increase in water volume/colonised river bed ratio).
   5. The impact of discharge on planktonic HNF mediated by the grazing impact of benthic predators was modelled, showing a good fit with the field data.

AB The focus of this study is the response of species to time of snowmelt and altitude in alpine areas and an examination of changes in species response to snowmelt as attitude increases and temperature decreases. Transects (n = 43) were placed evenly along an altitudinal gradient at Finse, Hardanger-vidda, western Norway, from ridges to late snowbeds. These gradients were systematically sampled ('Repeated Gradient Analysis, RGA') and an adjusted F-test was used to determine repeated trends in species distribution along the transects. Of the 41 taxa analysed 22 showed a significant change in expected occurrence in response to time of snowmelt (when a site becomes free of snow) as altitude increased. Three types of response were observed: (1) no change in response: (2) increased occurrence as altitude increases, i.e. the taxon invades snow-free sites as altitude increases, and (3) decreased occurrence as altitude increases, i.e. the taxon retreats from snow covered areas. It is suggested that the changes in response are due to both environmental factors (temperature related) and biological interactions. Decreases in expected occurrence are probably due to increased environmental severity as altitude increases (temperature related decreases). These species are represented by taxa preferring intermediate cover of snow. The invasion of earlier snow-free sites is probably due to reduced competition from lee-side taxa as altitude increases. A predictive model based on the species-environmental relationships suggests that a 1 degreesK temperature increase changes the limits of occurrence in response to time of snowmelt from 3 to 20 days for the different taxa.

AB We examined the linkage between climate and interspecific plant interactions in New England salt marshes. Because harsh edaphic conditions in marshes can be ameliorated by neighboring plants, plant neighbors can have net competitive or facilitative interactions, depending on ambient physical stresses. In particular, high soil salinities, which are largely controlled by solar radiation and the evaporation of marsh porewater. can be ameliorated by plant neighbors under stressful conditions leading to facilitative interactions. Under less stressful edaphic conditions, these same neighbors may be competitors. In this paper, we use this mechanistic understanding of marsh plant interactions to examine the hypothesis that latitudinal and inter-annual variation in climate can influence the nature and strength of marsh plant species interactions. We quantified the relationship between climate and species interactions by transplanting marsh plants into ambient vegetation and unvegetated bare patches at sites north and south of Cape Cod, a major biogeographic barrier on the east coast of North America. We hypothesized that the cooler climate north of Cape Cod would lead to fewer positive interactions among marsh plants. We found both latitudinal and inter-annual variation in the neighbor relations of marsh plants that paralleled latitudinal differences in temperature and salinity. South of Cape Cod, plant neighbor interactions tended to be more facilitative, whereas north of Cape Cod, plant neighbor interactions were more competitive. At all sites, soil salinity increased and plant neighbor interactions were more facilitative in warmer versus cooler years. Our results show that interspecific interactions can be strikingly linked to climate. but also reveal that because the sensitivity of specific species interactions to climatic variation is highly variable, predicting how entire communities will respond to climate change will be difficult, even in relatively simple, well-studied systems.

ID DIVERSITY; SYSTEMS; PATTERNS
AB The increase in richness of species and higher taxa going from higher to lower latitudes is one of the most studied global biogeographical patterns. Latitudinal trends in the interactions between species have, in contrast, hardly been studied at all, probably because recording interactions is much less straightforward than counting species. We have assembled two independent data sets which suggest that plant-pollinator interactions are not more ecologically specialised in the tropics compared to temperate latitudes. This is in contrast to a prevailing view that tropical ecological interactions tend towards higher specificity than their temperate counterparts.

AB Despite recent findings that mutualistic interactions between two species may be greatly affected by species external to the mutualism the implications of such multi-species interactions for the population dynamics of the mutualists are virtually unexplored. In this paper, we ask how the mutualism between the shoot-base boring weevil Apion onopordi and the rust fungus Puccinia punctiformis is influenced by the dynamics of their shared host plant Cirsium arvense, and vice versa. In particular, we hypothesized that the distribution of the weevil's egg load between healthy and rust-infected thistles may regulate the abundance of the mutualists and their host plant. In contrast to our expectations we found that the dynamics of the mutualists are largely determined by the dynamics of their host. This is, to our knowledge, the first demonstration that the dynamics of a mutualism are driven by a third, non-mutualistic species.

AB Sublethal effects of predators on the growth of their prey have been little studied in marine systems and consequently their importance relative to other factors is poorly known. Using a set of field experiments conducted on small artificial patch reefs, we measured the relative importance of the effects of predators and conspecific competitors on the growth of a temperate reef fish, the blackeye goby Coryphopterus nicholsii, and we measured how the importance of the 2 processes varied over time. We found that predators and competitors reduced the growth of the gobies at some times, but not others, and that the relative importance of the 2 processes varied among time periods. Moreover, the importance of the 2 processes varied as a function of body size, with large, fast-growing individuals suffering relatively more from the effects of predators than small, slow-growing individuals, which felt the effects of competition more keenly. Competition increased the variation (CV) in growth rates within populations, but exposure to predators had no effect on growth variability. The strength of both the competitive and predatory effects on growth rates declined from summer to winter, but the effect of competition on growth variability did not change appreciably over time. The decline in the effects of competitors and predators on growth rates corresponded to predictable seasonal declines in water temperature and predator abundance. The relative importance of the sublethal effects of predators was greatest during the summer, when predators were most abundant. This study highlights the potential importance of sublethal effects of predators in marine systems and it suggests that the relative importance of predatory and competitive effects may vary in predictable seasonal and ontogenetic ways.

AB Marine cryptic species, taxa that are morphologically identical but genetically distinct, may be important and underestimated components of the ecosystem. The understanding of several ecological interactions, such as marine bioinvasions, could be altered by the correct description of the bioinvaders. Here, we have focused our study on the hardyhead silverside, Atherinomorus lacunosus, a Lessepsian migrant. Lessepsian migrants are those species that are invading the Mediterranean from the Red Sea via the Suez Canal. We PCR amplified and sequenced the mitochondrial control region from individuals collected from the Mediterranean and the northern and southern Red Sea. We found that the two Red Sea populations are likely to correspond to two previously undescribed cryptic species. We also found that the Mediterranean individuals group with the northern Red Sea species. The Mediterranean population showed high levels of genetic diversity and did not share haplotypes with the northern Red Sea population. Lessepsian invasion by A. lacunosus probably occurred repeatedly and is likely to still be occurring. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Human activities have strongly impacted natural communities through the introduction of non-native species in historical times. A frequently cited marine example is Littorina littorea , a common intertidal gastropod that was first reported in North America in 1840. The seemingly sudden appearance and rapid geographical spread of this species southward from Nova Scotia has led many researchers to consider L. littorea a human-mediated species introduction. This is despite allozyme and subfossil evidence that the `European periwinkle' was in North America long before 1840. Our mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequence data confirm that L. littorea has been in continuous residence in North America for at least 8000 years. It appears most likely that ecological interactions, rather than oceanographic or climatic forces, maintained the limited geographical distribution of L. littorea prior to the 19th century.

AB We report the results of a study investigating the influence of elevated CO2 on species interactions across three trophic levels: a plant (Brassica oleracea), two aphid herbivores (the generalist Myzus persicae and the specialist Brevicoryne brassicae), and two natural enemies (the coccinellid Hippodamia convergens (ladybird) and the parasitoid wasp Diaeretiella rapae). Brassica oleracea plants reared under elevated CO2 conditions (650 ppmv vs. 350 ppmv) were larger and had decreased water and nitrogen content. Brevicoryne brassicae reared on plants grown in elevated CO2 were larger and accumulated more fat, while there was no change in M. persicae traits. Fecundity of individual aphids appeared to be increased when reared on plants grown in elevated CO2. However, these differences were generally lost when aphids were reared in colonies, suggesting that such changes in plant quality will have subtile effects on aphid intraspecific interactions. Nevertheless, CO2 treatment did influence aphid distribution on plants, with significantly fewer M. persicae found on the shoots, and B. brassicae was only found on senescing leaves, when colonies were reared on plants grown in elevated CO2. We reared B. brassicae and M. persicae in competition on plants grown at both the CO2 concentration treatments. We found a significantly lower ratio of M. persicae: B. brassicae on plants grown under elevated CO2 conditions, strongly suggesting that increasing CO2 concentrations can alter the outcome of competition among insect herbivores. This was also reflected in the distribution of the aphids on the plants. While the CO2 treatment did not influence where B. brassicae were found, fewer M. persicae were present on senescing leaves under elevated CO2 conditions. Changes in plant quality resulting from the CO2 treatments did not appear to alter aphid quality as prey species, as the number consumed by the ladybird H. convergens, and the number parasitised by the parasitoid wasp D. rapae, did not change. To our knowledge, this study provides the first empirical evidence that changes in host plant quality mediated by increasing levels of CO2 can alter the outcome of interspecific competition among insect herbivores.

AB Frequent dispersal events are expected to elevate local species richness in island-like habitats such as lakes. However, the importance of dispersal can be hard to evaluate if other factors cause large background variability in species composition and richness. In this paper, we review empirical studies on ecological factors known or expected to influence species richness in zooplankton communities of inland lakes. We then present summaries of two recent case studies. Our objectives are twofold: we first look for effects of biotic interactions on species richness and species composition, and then evaluate whether the expected effects of dispersal are likely to be detected on a background of large variability caused by other ecological factors and interactions. Species richness within lakes appears to be primarily controlled by factors related to lake size, lake productivity, water quality, and fish predation levels. One case study indicated a slight, but significant, positive effect of lake density and lake area in the surrounding landscape on species richness, suggesting that frequent dispersal events may enhance species richness. This local variation in species richness is superimposed on regional variation in species pools. (C) 2002 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Niche breadth of species has been hypothesized to be associated with species' responses to disturbance. Disturbance is usually believed to affect specialists negatively, while generalists are believed to benefit from disturbance; we call this the "specialization-disturbance" hypothesis. We also propose an associated hypothesis (the "specialization-asymmetry-disturbance" hypothesis) under which both specialization and asymmetry of interactions would explain species' responses to disturbance. We test these hypotheses using data from a plant-pollinator system that has been grazed by cattle (i.e., a biological disturbance) in southern Argentina. We quantified specialization in species interactions, specialization of interaction partners, and species' responses to disturbance. We found no relationship between degree of specialization and a species' response to disturbance. We also found that plant-pollinator interactions tend to be asymmetric in this system; there was no relationship between the degree of specialization of a given species and the degree of specialization of its interaction partners. However, asymmetry of interactions did not explain the variability in species' responses to disturbance. Thus, both hypotheses are rejected by our data. Possible reasons include failure to assess crucial resources, substantial direct effects of disturbance, inaccurate measures of specialization, difficulty detecting highly nonlinear relationships, and limitations of a nonexperimental approach. Or, in fact, there may be no relationship between specialization and response to disturbance.

AB Hypotheses concerning community-level vulnerability to invasion often emphasize biotic interactions but fail to consider fine-scale variation in the physical environment. In this study, the interplay between interspecific competition and abiotic factors is examined with respect to whether scrub habitats in southern California become invaded by the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile). Argentine ants penetrate further into and attain higher abundances in mesic scrub fragments than they do in xeric scrub fragments. Probably as a result, native ant richness is lower in small (<30 ha), mesic fragments than in either small, xeric fragments or in small plots in unfragmented areas. Compared to six species of native ants, Argentine ants ranked lowest in their ability to tolerate high temperatures in the laboratory with 100% of field-collected workers dying after 60 min of exposure to temperatures greater than or equal to46degreesC. Field data corroborate these results; mean temperatures at which colonies of Argentine ants attained maximum abundance at baits (34.0degreesC) and abandoned baits (41.6degreesC) were both lower than for the native ant Dorymyrtnex insanus. Laboratory studies further revealed that low levels of soil moisture depress mean worker survival in experimental colonies of Argentine ants. In a factorial laboratory experiment that varied both physical conditions and interspecific competition, Argentine ants exhibited greater worker activity and survival under warm, moist conditions than under hot, dry conditions, whereas the presence of a competitor, Forelius mccooki, had no significant effect. Experimental colonies of F. mccooki, in contrast, were more active under hot, dry conditions than under warm, moist conditions and exhibited reduced activity in the presence of L. humile irrespective of physical conditions. Taken together, these experimental data demonstrate how the abiotic environment impinges on both colony-level activity and colony growth in the Argentine ant and provide a general explanation for the patterns observed at the community level. A key consequence of the condition-specific nature of the competitive asymmetry between Argentine ants and native ants is that community-level vulnerability to invasion appears to depend primarily on the suitability of the physical environment from the perspective of L. humile.

AB Causes for the decline of the federally endangered Topeka shiner (Notropis topeka) are unclear. I used a database of fish community samples in Missouri, dating from 1938 to the present, to investigate spatial and temporal patterns of species occurring within the range of N. topeka. I used what is known about other species associated with N. topeka to provide falsifying evidence for the alternative hypotheses for the decline of N. topeka. Seven species showed a strong decline and four showed a strong expansion over time. Strongly declined species were Ameiurus melas, Carpiodes carpio, Hybognathus placitus, Lepomis humilis, N. topeka, Phenacobius mirabilis, and Pimephales promelas. Strongly expanded species were Fundulus notatus, Lepomis macrochirus, Micropterus salmoides, and Semotilus atromaculatus. Notropis topeka retreated to small, high-gradient streams over time, but this was not a general pattern among other species. In the 1990s, declined species were generally less abundant than expanded species. Declined species were negatively associated with three of the expanded species: F notatus, L. macrochirus, and M. salmoides. Declined species were not associated in general, but the same three expanded species were positively associated. Information from the literature showed declined species to be generally tolerant of physical/chemical stress but intolerant of species interactions. Information from this longterm data set and current knowledge of these species generally contradicted the physical/chemical hypotheses but not the species interaction hypotheses for the decline of N. topeka.

AB There is currently much debate about the relative importance of two contrasting mechanisms thought to be involved in regulating plant communities. One of these mechanisms is thought to result from species which possess particular traits, becoming dominant within the community and thus determining the abundance of,other species. The second mechanism is thought to result from the complementarity of different species exploiting different resources and thus promoting co-existence. To investigate the relevant importance of these two mechanisms, a series of pot experiments were performed in which the competitive relationships of eight species of grass were estimated in monoculture, in pair-wise comparisons and by the impact of their removal on the remaining community. Although superficially above-ground biomass appeared to be a good predictor of competitive ability, more detailed analysis revealed that size was ineffective as a predictor of a species' impact on a community. In contrast there was evidence that complementarity was important in determining species-species interactions both at the level of pairs of species and even more so at community level. It is argued that complementarity is more important in diverse communities than in pair-wise interactions because complementarity is an emergent property of species diversity.

TI Wyoming big sagebrush density: Effects of seeding rates and grass
   competition

   competition; seeding rates
ID LANDS
AB The mining industry commonly seeds shrubs and grasses concurrently on coal-mined lands of northeastern Wyoming, but ecological interactions between seeded shrubs and grasses are not well documented. Artemisia tridentata Nutt. ssp. wyomingensis (Beetle and Young) (Wyoming big sagebrush) is the dominant pre-mining shrub on many Wyoming mine sites. Despite past failures to establish Wyoming big sagebrush, the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality, Land Quality Division's rules and regulations require establishment of 1 shrub per m(2) on 20% of post-mined land in Wyoming. A study was established at the Belle Ayr Coal Mine south of Gillette, Wyoming to evaluate the effects of sagebrush seeding rates and grass competition on Wyoming big sagebrush seedling density. Three sagebrush seeding rates (1, 2, and 4 kg pure live seed [pls]/ha; 350, 700, and 1,400 pls/m(2) , respectively) and seven cool-season perennial grass mixture seeding rates (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 14 kg pls/ha; 0, 187, 374, 561, 750, 935, and 1,309 pls/m(2) , respectively) were applied during winter 1998-1999. Pascopyrum smithii (Rydb.) A. Love (western wheatgrass), Elymus lanceolatus (Scribner & J.G. Smith) Gould (thickspike wheatgrass), and Elymus trachycaulus (Link) Gould ex Shinners (slender wheatgrass) comprised the grass seed mix (equal seed numbers of each species). Sagebrush seedling density differed among sagebrush seeding rates but not among grass seeding rates. On all sampling dates in 1999 and 2000, sagebrush seedling density differed among sagebrush rates and was greatest at the 4 kg pls/ha sagebrush seeding rate. All sagebrush seeding rates provided densities of at least 1 shrub per m(2) after two growing seasons. Grass density and production in 2000 suggest that adequate grass production (greater than or equal to75 g/m(2) ) was achieved by seeding at 6 to 8 kg pls/ha. Within these grass seeding rates, four or more sagebrush seedlings per m(2) were attained when sagebrush was seeded at 2 to 4 kg pls/ha. Use of these seeding rate combinations in mine reclamation can achieve Wyoming big sagebrush standards and reduce reseeding costs.

AB The structure of pollination networks is described for two oceanic islands, the Azorean Flores and the Mauritian Ile aux Aigrettes. At each island site, all interactions between endemic, non-endemic native and introduced plants and pollinators were mapped. Linkage level, i.e. number of species interactions per species, was significantly higher for endemic species than for non-endemic native and introduced species. Linkage levels of the two latter categories were similar. Nine types of interaction may be recognized among endemic, non-endemic native and introduced plants and pollinators. Similar types had similar frequencies in the two networks. Specifically, we looked for the presence of 'invader complexes' of mutualists, defined as groups of introduced species interacting more with each other than expected by chance and thus facilitating each other's establishment. On both islands, observed frequencies of interactions between native (endemic and non-endemic) and introduced pollinators and plants differed from random. Introduced pollinators and plants interacted less than expected by chance. Thus, the data did not support the existence of invader complexes. Instead, our study suggested that endemic super-generalist species, i.e. pollinators or plant species with a very wide pollination niche, include new invaders in their set of food plants or pollinators and thereby improve establishment success of the invaders. Reviewing other studies, super generalists seem to be a widespread island phenomenon, i.e. island pollination networks include one or a few species with a very high generalization level compared to co-occurring species. Low density of island species may lead to low interspecific competition, high abundance and ultimately wide niches and super generalization.

AB There has been much literature on ecological model of Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) game. This game illustrates that cooperation can evolve in situations where individuals tend to look after themselves. In order to explain some behaviors of altruism in animal societies, the strategy All Cooperate (AC), often called the Golden Rule, is more appropriate than other strategies. However, very little is known about the superiority of AC. In the present article, we study patch dynamics based on non-iterated PD game, applying two different methods: island and lattice models. Each patch is assumed to be either vacant or composed of a population of AC or All Defect (AD), where AD means a selfish strategy. Both models exhibit a phase transition between a phase where both AC and AD survive, and a phase where AD is extinct. The latter phase means that AC beats AD completely. In the case of lattice model, the extinction of AD easily occurs and the abundance of AC takes a larger value, compared with the island model. Our models can be also extended to general iterated PD game; we describe the reason why AC can outperform any other strategy. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We investigated patterns of mammal assemblage structure on the Atherton Tableland in the Wet Tropics biogeographic region of northeastern Australia. We used live trapping and quantitative estimates of stratified vegetation density to examine the relationships between the structure of the mammal assemblage and habitat structure over three nested spatial scales across a natural vegetation gradient from rain forest to dry, open forest. The narrow transition zone enabled us to examine the relationships between mammal assemblage structure and habitat structure while minimizing the confounding effects of distance, climate, and biogeographic history. The structure of the mammal assemblages was closely related to vegetation structure across and within habitats, and over all spatial scales examined. Vegetation complexity and heterogeneity both influenced assemblage structure, but the relationships varied with spatial scale, Species richness was highest in the open forest and decreased across the gradient into the rain forest. Point diversity was only weakly explained by vegetation structure, whereas >80% of the variation in species richness at the local scale could be explained by vegetation structure. Local-scale species richness of ground-dwelling mammals was mostly a product of the spatial variability in assemblage structure (beta diversity), which was associated with the spatial variability in vegetation structure. Local-scale liabitat heterogeneity thus promoted local-scale species richness via the close ecological interaction between mammals and habitat structure. The multiscale approach used here, and the nesting of spatial variability in within-habitat vegetation structure, enabled us to demonstrate the scale-dependent effects of spatial habitat heterogeneity and complexity on the structure and diversity of the small-mammal assemblage.

AB Most ecological processes and interactions depend on scales much larger than a single habitat, and therefore it is important to link spatial patterns and ecological processes at a landscape scale. Here, we analyzed the effects of landscape context on the distribution of bees (Hymenoptera: Apoidea) at multiple spatial scales with respect to the following hypotheses: (1) Local abundance and diversity of bees increase with increasing proportion of the surrounding seminatural habitats. (2) Solitary wild bees, bumble bees, and honey bees respond to landscape context at different spatial scales, We selected 15 landscape sectors and determined the percentage of seminatural habitats and the diversity of habitat types at eight spatial scales (radius 250-3000 m) by field inspections and analyses of vegetation maps using two Geographic Information Systems. The percentage of seminatural habitats varied between 1.4% and 28%. In the center of each landscape sector a patch of potted flowering plants (four perennial and two annual species) was placed in the same habitat type, a grassy field margin adjacent to cereal fields. In all, 865 wild bee individuals and 467 honey bees were observed and an additional 475 individuals were caught for species identification, Species richness and abundance of solitary wild bees showed a close positive correlation with the percentage of seminatural habitats at small scales up to 750 in, whereas bumble bees and honey bees did not respond to landscape context at these scales. In contrast, honey bees were correlated with landscape context at large scales. The densities of flower-visiting honey bees even increased with decreasing proportion of seminatural habitats at a radius of 3000 m. We are not aware of any empirical studies showing contrasting foraging patterns related to landscape context at different spatial scales. We conclude (1) that local landscape destruction affects solitary wild bees more than social bees, possibly changing mutualistic plant-pollinator and competitive wild bees-honey bees interactions and (2) that only analyses of multiple spatial scales may detect the importance of the landscape context for local pollinator communities.

AB Some of the best empirical examples of life-history evolution involve responses to predation. Nevertheless, most life-history theory dealing with responses to predation has not been formulated within an explicit dynamic food-web context. In particular, most previous theory does not explicitly consider the coupled population dynamics of the focal species and its predators and resources. Here we present a model of life-history evolution that explores the evolutionary consequences of size-specific predation on small individuals when there is a trade-off between growth and reproduction. The model explicitly describes the population dynamics of a predator, the prey of interest, and its resource. The selective forces that cause life-history evolution in the prey species emerge from the ecological interactions embodied by this model and can involve important elements of frequency dependence. Our results demonstrate that the strength of the coupling between predator and prey in the community determines many aspects of life-history evolution. If the coupling is weak (as is implicitly assumed in many previous models), differences in resource productivity have no effect on the nature of life-history evolution. A single life-history strategy is favored that minimizes the equilibrium resource density (if possible). If the coupling is strong, then higher resource productivities select for faster growth into the predation size refuge. Moreover, under strong coupling it is also possible for natural selection to favor an evolutionary diversification of life histories, possibly resulting in two coexisting species with divergent life-history strategies.

AB Most animals actively avoid predators. If such a reaction reduces competitive ability, for example by reducing food intake, predator presence can lead to trait-mediated indirect effects. Because predator avoidance typically leads to reduced growth rather than reduced survival, its effect on population processes is difficult to assess. This is especially true for organisms with complex life-cycles, where predator avoidance during one stage is expected to lead to trait-mediated indirect effects if it has effects reaching into the following life stages. I experimentally investigated the effect of caged (thus non-lethal) dragonfly larvae on the competition between tadpoles of two frog species (Rana lessonae and R. esculenta) and on juvenile frog survival during the subsequent terrestrial stage. In response to caged predators, R. lessonae delayed metamorphosis more than R. esculenta, but they both metamorphosed heavier. These differences suggest the possibility of a competitive disadvantage for R. lessonae in the presence of predators, which could lead to trait-mediated indirect effects. However, the presence of predators did not modify competitive effects and had no measurable consequences on terrestrial survival. Regardless of the presence of predators, competition during the larval stage had large effects on metamorphosis and led to strongly decreased survival in the subsequent terrestrial stage. These results suggest that trait-mediated indirect effects are not important in this system, because the predator reaction of the tadpoles in both species had no measurable effect on the following life stage and, therefore, probably no strong effect on community dynamics.

AB 1. Despite wide recognition that fish assemblages are influenced by factors operating over a range of spatial scales, little effort has been devoted to quantifying large-scale variation and the multiscale dependencies of assemblage patterns and processes. This is particularly true for Mediterranean streams, where seasonally predictable drying-up may lead to a strong association between assemblage attributes and large-scale factors affecting the distribution of population sources and extinction likelihood.
   2. The contribution of large-scale factors to stream fish assemblage variation was quantified across a Mediterranean landscape, in south-west Portugal. Fish abundance and species composition were estimated at 166 sites across third- to sixth-order streams, in March-July 1998. Variance partitioning by redundancy analyses was used to analyse assemblage variation against three sets of predictor variables: environmental (catchment position, and geomorphic and hydrological factors), large-scale spatial trends and neighbourhood effects.
   3. Environmental variables and spatial trends accounted for 34.6% of the assemblage variation across the entire region, and for 36.6 and 57.8% within the two largest catchments (Mira and Seixe). Neighbourhood effects were analysed at the catchment scale, increasing the explained variation to 56.1% (Mira) and 70.7% (Seixe).
   4. A prevailing environmental gradient was reflected in an increase in the abundance of all species and size-classes in relation to catchment position, with more fish present in larger streams and in downstream reaches. Variables describing geomorphic and hydrological settings were less important in explaining assemblage variation.
   5. Spatial trends always accounted for the smallest fraction of assemblage variation, and they were probably associated with historical barriers to fish dispersal. The strong neighbourhood effects may be related to spatially autocorrelated habitat conditions, but they are also a likely consequence of fish emigration/extinction and colonisation processes.
   6. These results emphasise that a substantial proportion of fish assemblage variation in Mediterranean streams may be explained by large-scale factors, irrespective of microhabitats and local biotic interactions. It is suggested that this pattern results to a large extent from the seasonal drying-up, with the summer shortage of surface water limiting fish occurrence in headwaters, and consequently the key core areas for fish concentrating in larger streams and tributaries adjacent to large streams because of neighbourhood effects.

AB Environmental response genes are defined as those encoding proteins involved in interactions external to the organism, including interactions among organisms and between the organism and its abiotic environment. The general characteristics of environmental response genes include high diversity, proliferation by duplication events, rapid rates of evolution, and tissue-or temporal-specific expression. Thus, environmental response genes include those that encode proteins involved in the manufacture, binding, transport, and breakdown of semiochemicals. Postgenomic elucidation of the function of such genes requires an understanding of the chemical ecology of the organism and, in particular, of the "small molecules" that act as selective agents either by promoting survival or causing selective mortality. In this overview, the significance of several groups of environmental response genes is examined in the context of chemical ecology. Cytochrome P-450 monooxygenases provide a case in point; these enzymes are involved in the biosynthesis of furanocoumarins (furocoumarins), toxic allelochemicals, in plants, as well as in their detoxification by lepidopterans. Biochemical innovations in insects and plants have historically been broadly defined in a coevolutionary context. Considerable insight can be gained by defining with greater precision components of those broad traits that contribute to diversification. Molecular approaches now allow chemical ecologists to characterize specifically those biochemical innovations postulated to lead to adaptation and diversification in plant/insect interactions.

AB Understanding how species interactions shape the structure of ecological communities based on pairwise comparisons has been a difficult undertaking for ecologists because effects in reassembled communities can be different than simple density-mediated interactions would suggest. Part of this complexity occurs because many species change their behavior and morphology with different predators and competitors and, thus, change their per-capita interaction rates (i.e. trait-mediated interactions). Our objective was to use a simple experimental community of two predators (larval dragonflies, Anax longipes, and larval salamanders, Ambystoma tigrinum), two prey (larval green frogs, Rana clamitans, and larval bullfrogs, R. catesbeiana), and a shared prey resource to determine whether we can predict interactions in a reassembled community by combining our knowledge of density- and trait-mediated interactions,. We combined pairwise laboratory experiments on predation rates and predator-induced behaviors with a mesocosm experiment to examine density- and trait-mediated effects. We used a factorial combination of no predators, caged Anax (to induce anti-predator traits without changing prey density), and lethal Anax crossed with no predators, caged Ambystoma, and lethal Amkystoina. The species interactions in the reassembled community were qualitatively predictable based on the pairwise experiments. Lethal Anax preyed upon Ambystoma and green frogs while lethal Ambystoma only preyed upon green frogs. Anax also reduced the activity of the green frogs; this caused a decrease in salamander predation on green frogs, a decrease in green frog acquisition of resources, and an increase in bullfrog acquisition of resources. Ambystoma had no effect on green frog activity, no effect on resource acquisition by green frogs, and no effect on resource acquisition by bullfrogs. These results suggest that we can better understand how species interact in natural communities if we have a more detailed understanding of trait-mediated mechanisms. However, if predicting the structure of large communities requires identifying how each species alters its traits in the presence of all other species along with altering density, improving our predictive ability may be a prohibitively large undertaking.

AB The importance of wood ants (Formica rufa) in determining the community structure (defined as the relative abundance of component species) and smallscale distribution of carabids was examined in a mature Scots pine stand in the New Forest, southern England. Carabids and wood ants were sampled by pitfall trapping throughout the forest stand from March to September 1998. The abundance of individual carabid species were modelled using vegetation type (grass or bracken), litter depth and wood ant density as independent explanatory variables. Models were fitted using a maximum-likelihood method (GLIM v.3.77; Baker 1985) with the assumption of a Poisson distribution, using a log-link function. Areas of high wood ant density were characterised by low abundance and species richness of carabids and high percentage dominance by the most commonly sampled species, Abax parallelepipedus. The extent and type of vegetation cover was found to influence the distribution and abundance of certain carabid species but only in areas where the density of wood ants was low. Large-bodied species occurred more frequently in bracken-dominated patches where the litter layer was deeper and the density of potential prey items was higher. Wood ant density was found to be the most important determinant of carabid species abundance in the study site.

AB Investigating the effect of biodiversity on the stability of ecological communities is complicated by the numerous ways in which models of community interactions can be formulated. This has led to differences in conclusions and interpretations of how the number of species in a community affects its stability. Here, we derive a simple, general relationship between the coefficient of variation (CV) of combined species densities and the environmentally driven variability in species' per capita population growth rates. For a given level of environmentally driven variability in per capita population growth rates, increasing the number of species in a community decreases the CV of combined species densities, provided that species do not respond to environmental fluctuations in a perfectly correlated way. Thus, a community with more species of competitors will be more stable (have lower CV in combined species densities for a given level of environmental variability) than a species-poor community, provided that the species in both communities show equal variability in per capita population growth rates and provided that species within each community do not show strongly correlated responses to environmental fluctuations. This conclusion also applies to "non-interactive" models in which there is no competition between species.

AB Habitat destruction and fragmentation of remaining habitat are major threats to global biodiversity. In this paper, we drew upon data from grassland butterflies, legume-feeding herbivores and their parasitoids, and the interactions between rape pollen beetles and their paraitoids in the agricultural landscapes of Germany to explore the following issues: (1) the relative importance of small habitat fragments for the conservation of biodiversity (in contrast to the prevailing arguments in favor of large fragments); (2) the disruption of interspecific interactions in fragmented habitats and (3) the relative importance of the spatial arrangement of habitat fragments in landscapes of different complexity.
   The percentage of polyphagous butterfly species and their abundance were higher in small than in large calcareous grassland fragments, showing the relative importance of the landscape surrounding habitat fragments for less specialized species. A landscape perspective is also needed to explain why several small fragments supported more butterfly species (even when only endangered species were considered) than the same area composed of only one or two fragments. Analyses of insects on legumes showed trophic-level differences, in that species numbers of parasitoids, but not of herbivores, benefited from habitat subdivision in landscapes. As percentage of parasitism (i.e., the strength of ecological interactions) increased with fragment area, both the "several small" and "single large" strategies appeared to have merit. An intermediate-fragmentation strategy of habitat conservation in human-dominated landscapes may combine the advantages. Small habitat fragments should be scattered enough to cover a range of geographical area wide enough to maximize beta diversity and the spreading of but with large habitat fragments close enough to enable dispersal among fragments, to reduce the extinction probability of area-sensitive species, and to stabilize predator-prey interactions.
   Parasitism of rape pollen beetles exhibited a distinct edge effect: it was higher near the crop field edge, i.e., near the parasitoids' overwintering sites (such as grassy strips). However, this was only true in landscape, dominated by annual crops in landscapes with a high percentage of permanent noncrop area (>20%), such edge effects disappeared, presumably because of the high overall density or these parasitoids. These data indicate that spatial configuration is important to mitigate extinction risks when habitat availability in a landscape is low, whereas no effect will be observed when overall area of habitat is high.

AB Restored soils are often low in organic matter (OM). As a result, OM is applied to increase soil fertility. Earthworms can assist soil incorporation of OM, but feeding behaviours, and as a result their roles in this process, differ between species. Laboratory experiments examined the effects of OM availability on the growth and behaviour of Aporrectodea longa and Lumbricus terrestris. Hatchling growth was recorded from 11 vessels containing soil and OM (separated cattle solids), either surface applied (SUR) or mixed into the soil (MIX). Growth of L. terrestris was also recorded where separated cattle solids (SCS) were concentrated in bands at the surface (SUR) or at depths of 0.03 (UPP) or 0.08 m (LOW). In a further experiment, L. terrestris and L. rubellus were kept in mono-species cultures and paired combination, in treatments with selected SCS placements, which allowed assessment of OM position on species interactions. After 28 weeks, both L. terrestris and A. longa exhibited significantly greater growth rates (P < 0.05) in SUR treatments. The behaviour of both species changed with time. L. terrestris were located in areas where OM was concentrated. After 24 weeks, mean masses of 3.1, 2.2 and 1.6 g were recorded for SUR, UPP and LOW treatments, respectively. Where L. rubellus and L. terrestris were co-cultured, the former had significant (P < 0.05) negative effects on the growth of the latter, but only when surface OM was limited. At restored sites, application of OM may be important in the development of sustainable earthworm populations and hence their role in soil amelioration.

AB 1 The effects of natural variation in herbivory, local competition, plant size, and fruit production on next year's growth, survival and inflorescence production of individuals in natural populations of Calathea ovandensis were estimated during 5 years.
   2 For each year, we estimated path coefficients (by standardized multiple regression analysis) for the direct effects of predictor variables on demographic rates. Separate analyses were performed for each life-history stage: seedlings, juveniles, pre-reproductives and reproductives, for a total of 55 analyses. Emergent patterns for stages were evaluated (Fisher's combined probability test) by combining years. To determine significance of effects in single years, we calculated table-wide probabilities for each stage across multiple years (Bonferroni sequential test). Emergent patterns for years were also evaluated (Fisher's combined probability test) by combining stages.
   3 Survival of seedlings was positively affected by plant size and negatively affected by local competition. Survival of juveniles was positively affected by plant size, but not by other factors. Survival of large stages was not generally affected by any of the factors.
   4 Relative growth rates of all stages were negatively affected by plant size; larger plants grew more slowly than smaller plants. Additionally, growth rate of juveniles was negatively affected by local competition, whereas growth rate of reproductives was positively affected by reproduction.
   5 Next year's inflorescence production was positively affected by plant size for both pre-reproductive and reproductive stages. For reproductives, it was additionally positively affected by current fruit production.
   6 Analysis of differences among years showed that herbivory negatively affected both survival and growth in 1985, but not in other years, whereas local competition negatively affected survival in 1983 and growth in 1984.
   7 Effects of biotic interactions varied among stages and through time. The large effects of competition on seedlings and juveniles was as expected, but the small effect of herbivory on small plants was surprising as was the striking temporal variation in its effect and its impact on large plants.

AB Ecological interactions and the natural selection they cause play a prominent causal role in biological diversification and speciation. As a discipline, ecological genetics integrates the two components of adaptive evolution (natural selection and genetic variability) to study the mechanisms of evolution. Ecological genetics is a fruitful approach to the study of how reproductive isolation can evolve under natural selection. The essence of this way of thinking and the ways in which it can be used to address persistent open questions in speciation are discussed.

AB Local biological communities are made up of species, each of which has its own particular relationship with the environment. To the extent that these autecological niches limit species' distributions, and by extension community composition, models of species' ecological niches can predict species composition at particular sites, or at least provide a null hypothesis of potential species composition in the absence of effects of species interactions. We developed distributional predictions (ecological niche models) for 89 species occurring in dry tropical forest in the Balsas Basin of south-western Mexico using an interpolation technique, and predicted the species likely to occur at 8 sites across the region. Onsite field inventory data were then used to test the community predictions, all of which were statistically significant. These results suggest that inventory efforts can be made more efficient by development beforehand of hypotheses that focus onsite collecting and inventory.

AB Ecological common sense says that decreased solar energy should reduce herbivore production because of reduced energy flow through primary producers. However, a field experiment in a phosphorus-limited lake showed that production of zooplankton herbivores was increased by shading. This paradoxical outcome was caused by a decoupling of producer carbon fixation and nutrient uptake under high light that reduced food quality for herbivores. At low nutrient supplies, shading increased nutrient contents relative to carbon within algal food, outweighing effects of decreased primary production. Thus, light/ nutrient balance affects the degree of mismatch between primary producers and herbivores in nature, which in turn influences mass-transfer efficiencies along food chains. To predict how energy transfer efficiency and biological interactions will respond to perturbations, it is essential to take into account changes in light/nutrient balance and its effects on the stoichiometry of autotroph-herbivore interactions.

AB Studies on the implications of food web interactions to community structure have often focused on density-mediated interactions between predators and their prey. This approach emphasizes the importance of predator regulation of prey density via consumption (i.e. lethal effects), which, in turn, leads to cascading effects on the prey's resources. A more recent and contrasting view emphasizes the importance of non-lethal predator effects on prey traits (e.g. behaviour, morphology), or trait-mediated interactions. On rocky intertidal shores in New England, green crab (Carcinus maenas) predation is thought to be important to patterns of algal abundance and diversity by regulating the density of herbivorous snails (Littorina littorea). We found, however, that risk cues from green crabs can dramatically suppress snail grazing, with large effects on fucoid algal communities. Our results suggest that predator-induced changes in prey behaviour may be an important and under-appreciated component of food web interactions and community dynamics on rocky intertidal shores.

AB Synopsis
   Territorial behaviour is a conspicuous determinant of social organisation in many reef fishes including parrotfishes. Most parrotfish studies in the Caribbean have focused on the species Scarus iserti and Sparisoma viride over limited ranges of reef habitat. By contrast, our study has included all common parrotfishes in Belize (Sc. iserti, Sp. viride, Sparisoma aurofrenatum, Sparisoma chrysopterum. and Sparisoma rubripinne) at three sites with different physical and biotic conditions and a wide range of fish densities. Density in Sc. iserti was strongly positively correlated to substrate rugosity. In contrast, densities of Sp. chrysopterum and Sp. rubripinne were unrelated to rugosity and territories were large. Territory size was smallest in Sc. iserti (mean areas at the three sites ranged from 41 to 120 m(2)) and largest in Sp. rubripinne (ranged from 168 to 1400 m(2)). All species except Sp. chrysopterum exhibited significantly larger territories where density was low as suggested by territory theory. Territory size decreased rapidly with increasing density of competitors. Patterns of harem size differed between two groups of parrotfishes. (1) Sc. iserti, Sp. viride, and Sp. aurofrenatum exhibited an expected positive correlation with territory size. (2) Harem size was smaller in Sp. rubripinne and Sp. chrysopterum, and showed no spatial pattern. Aggression in Sp. viride and Sc. iserti was directed entirely towards intraspecifics and positively density dependent. Interspecific interactions accounted for only 10% of observations and were recorded exclusively whilst following Sp. chrysopterum, Sp. rubripinne, and, to a lesser extent, Sp. aurofrenatum. A meta analysis of species interactions suggested that intraspecific interactions were most common where overall fish density was greatest and conversely, interspecific interactions occurred more often at lower densities. This may suggest that the economic defensibility of territories is largely confined to intraspecifics where density is greatest. Most (62%) of the interspecific interactions comprised Sp. rubripinne chasing the smaller species Sp. chrysopterum. suggesting that territorial behaviour has at least some non-reproductive origin and may therefore be associated with either food or shelter. It is feasible that at such low population densities, it is economically feasible for Sp. rubripinne to defend against intraspecifics and Sp. chrysopterum. Social behaviour in Sp. chrysopterum and Sp. rubripinne. and to a lesser extent Sp. aurofrenatum, differs to that of Sc. iserti and Sp. viride which conform to existing theories of social behaviour in reef fish.

AB 1. Zooplankton density and biomass was examined in a Danube River floodplain section with highly variable hydrological dynamics. Temporal patterns were analysed to assess the effects of hydrological conditions on zooplankton community structure and the differential response of the two major zooplankton taxa, rotifers and crustaceans.
   2. Calculated floodplain water age was used as an integrated parameter describing hydrological conditions and connectivity.
   3. Total zooplankton biomass, crustacean biomass and crustacean species number were significantly positively related to water age. Rotifer biomass followed a hump-shaped relationship with water age, and rotifer species number decreased with increasing water age.
   4. Rotifers dominated the community in periods of low to medium water ages. In periods of higher water ages the community was dominated by crustaceans.
   5. We propose that the hydrological regime of floodplains is crucial for zooplankton biomass patterns and succession, through the alternation of washing-out effects, taxon-specific potential of reproduction and biological interactions. Flood events and high water levels reset the community to an early successional phase.

AB 1. Predator : prey ratios are cited as examples of a community level pattern, which suggests underlying assembly rules. Consistent ratios may result from either holistic community interactions or individualistic species assembly. This study tested for evidence of holistic or individualistic explanations for the predator : prey ratios among invertebrate communities of temporary ponds.
   2. Macroinvertebrate species were recorded from 30 adjacent experimental ponds, in January and early summer over 4 years. After the first 2 years either additional predatory or prey taxa were added to treatment ponds to skew the natural predator : prey ratios. Species richness and ratios were monitored for the following 2 years comparing treatment ponds subject to augmented predator or prey richness against unmanipulated control ponds.
   3. The majority of species added to treatments established in their respective ponds initially creating unusually high or low predator : prey ratios. In the 2 years following manipulation the ratios in treatment and control ponds converged. The convergence resulted from the spread of the additional species across all the ponds rather than acquisition or extinction of species within treatment ponds compensating for the skewed ratios.
   4. Convergent predator : prey ratios resulted from the spread of the augmented local species pool across the site rather than holistic community level adjustment within separate ponds. The results support individualistic models of community assembly as the explanation for convergent predator : prey ratios in pond habitats.

AB 1. We examined the species richness of theoretical communities in relation to interaction strength between species.
   2. To do so, we used randomly constructed interaction matt-ices for competitive systems. To determine co-existence. we tested for local stability and equilibrium feasibility of these theoretical assemblages.
   3. As expected, we found that a low mean species interaction strength could allow for many species to co-exist. However, variance in the interaction strengths may alter previous results: two systems with the same mean interaction strength show markedly different diversity depending critically on the magnitude of the variance. If species are similar enough then many can co-exist, even if they compete strongly.
   4. In addition we found that the species richness of a competitive community can greatly depend on the correlation between interaction strengths, an issue that so far has gone unreported. This correlation, a result of trade-offs between species' characteristics, may profoundly increase the potential for stable co-existence of a highly species-rich community.
   5. Competition may not be an anathema to diversity. Statistical properties of species' interactions may be critical factors that contribute to the explanation of species diversity in natural communities.

AB Aim Animal assemblages in fragmented landscapes are likely to be determined by contemporary (e.g. patch size, biotic interactions) and historical (e.g. change in patch area) characteristics of patches and their positioning in the landscape (e.g. connectivity). We considered the influence of habitat structure, landscape context, history and an aggressive, native bird species [the Noisy Miner Manorina melanocephala (Latham 1801)] on three characteristics of woodland-dependent bird assemblages in a fragmented, eucalypt-forest landscape. The response variables were: (1) species richness (SR), (2) sums-of-densities (i.e. total number of individual birds), and (3) occurrence of rare species [through a rare-species index (RSI)].
   Location Box-ironbark, eucalypt forests of central Victoria, Australia (broadly bounded by: 36-37degrees S, 142-146degrees E).
   Methods There were replicates of four size-classes of fragments (10, 20, 40, 80 ha) and replicates of the same size-classes set within large blocks of extant forest. This design allowed us to distinguish between area-specific and fragmentation effects by comparing same-sized fragments and reference areas to establish fragmentation-specific impacts.
   Results Species richness was less than expected in smaller fragments and this was apparently because of current fragment area, density of the Noisy Miner and habitat quality. The RSI exhibited similar dependencies, while sums-of-densities appeared to be related to the number and quality of wooded linkages to fragments. The historical variable was forested-area change of each fragment between 1963 and 1996, and was found to have no relationship to any of the response variables.
   Main conclusions The lack of historical influence suggested that the avifaunas of the fragments are unlikely to be `relaxing' from isolation effects through local extinctions, but are more likely to be dominated by dynamic recolonization and abandonment both seasonally and among years. The dependence of sums-of-densities on the linkage variable appeared to be largely because of the responses of two species, the Red Wattlebird Anthochaera curunculata (Shaw, 1790) and the Yellow-tufted Honeyeater Lichenostomus melanops (Latham, 1801). These species are among the three most common in the large forest blocks, but are much rarer in fragments. The connectedness effect suggests that these species may depend upon linkages to occupy fragments that are only moderately distant from large forested areas within this region.

AB A survey of recent literature indicates that competitive ability in plants has been measured, in most studies, only in terms of the relative intensity of size suppression experienced by competitors within one growing season. Far fewer studies have recorded relative success in terms of survival and even fewer studies have recorded fecundity under competition. Differences in size suppression are usually assumed to reflect differences in relative abilities to deny resources to competitors. However, most previous studies have failed to control or account for other sources of variation in the size suppression that plants experience under competition, i.e. variation between mixtures in the resource supply/demand ratio (approach to carrying capacity), or variation in the degree of niche overlap between competitors, or variation in the intensity of concurrent facilitative interactions between competitors. For future studies, much greater caution is required in recognizing these inherent limitations of traditional measures of competitive ability and, hence, guarding against unfounded conclusions or predictions about potential for competitive success that are based on these measures. There is also a significant challenge for future studies to adopt empirical approaches for minimizing these limitations. Some initial recommendations are considered here based on an emerging view of competitive ability measured in terms of traits associated with all three conventional components of Darwinian fitness, i.e. not just growth (plant size) but also survival and fecundity allocation (offspring production per unit plant size per unit time). According to this model, differences in competitive ability imply differences in the ability, despite intense competition (i.e. low resource supply/demand ratio), to recruit offspring into the next generation and thereby limit offspring recruitment by other plants. The important traits of competitive ability, therefore, are not only those that allow a plant to deny resources to competitors suppress their sizes and hence. maximize the plant's own size: but also those traits that allow the plant to withstand suppression from competition enough to persist, both as an individual (through survival) and across generations (through descendants).

AB The Siwalik formations of northern Pakistan consist of deposits of ancient rivers that existed throughout the early Miocene through the late Pliocene. The formations are highly fossiliferous with a diverse array of terrestrial and freshwater vertebrates, which in combination with exceptional lateral exposure and good chronostratigraphic control allows a more detailed and temporally resolved study of the sediments and faunas than is typical in terrestrial deposits. Consequently the Siwaliks provide an opportunity to document temporal differences in species richness, turnover, and ecological structure in a terrestrial setting, and to investigate how such differences are related to changes in the fluvial system, vegetation, and climate. Here we focus on the interval between 10.7 and 5.7 Ma, a time of significant local tectonic and global climatic change. It is also the interval with the best temporal calibration of Siwalik faunas and most comprehensive data on species occurrences. A methodological focus of this paper is on controlling sampling biases that confound biological and ecological signals. Such biases include uneven sampling through time, differential preservation of larger animals and more durable skeletal elements, errors in age-dating imposed by uncertainties in correlation and paleomagnetic timescale calibrations, and uneven taxonomic treatment across groups. We attempt to control for them primarily by using a relative-abundance model to estimate limits for the first and last appearances from the occurrence data. This model also incorporates uncertainties in a e estimates. Because of sampling limitations inherent in the terrestrial fossil record, our 100-Kyr temporal resolution may approach the finest possible level of resolution for studies of vertebrate faunal changes over periods of millions of years.
   Approximately 40,000 specimens from surface and screenwash collections made at 555 localities form the basis of our study. Sixty percent of the localities have maximum and minimum age estimates differing by 100 Kyr or less, 82% by 200 Kyr or less. The fossils represent 115 mammalian species or lineages of ten orders: Insectivora, Scandentia, Primates, Tubulidentata, Proboscidea, Pholidota, Lagomorpha, Perissodactyla, Artiodactyla, and Rodentia. Important taxa omitted from this study include Carnivora, Elephantoidea, and Rhinocerotidae. Because different collecting methods were used for large and small species, they are treated separately in analyses. Small species include insectivores, tree shrews, rodents, lagomorphs, and small primates. They generally weigh less than 5 kg.
   The sediments of the study interval were deposited by coexisting fluvial systems, with the larger emergent Nagri system being displaced between 10.1 and 9.0 Ma by an interfan Dhok Pathan system. In comparison to Nagri floodplains, Dhok Pathan floodplains were less well drained, with smaller rivers having more seasonally variable flow and more frequent avulsions. Paleosol sequences indicate reorganization of topography and drainage accompanying a transition to a more seasonal climate. A few paleosols may have formed under waterlogged, grassy woodlands, but most formed under drier conditions and more closed vegetation.
   The oxygen isotopic record also indicates significant change in the patterns of precipitation beginning at 9.2 Ma, in what may have been a shift to a drier and more seasonal climate. The carbon isotope record demonstrates that after 8.1 Ma significant amounts of C-4 grasses began to appear and that by 6.8 Ma floodplain habitats included extensive C-4 grasslands. Plant communities with predominantly C-4 plants were greatly diminished after 7.0 Ma, and those with predominantly C-4 plants, which would have been open woodlands or grassy woodlands, appeared as early as 7.4 Ma.
   Inferred first and last appearances show a constant, low level of faunal turnover throughout the interval 10.7-5.7-Ma, with three short periods of elevated turnover at 10.3, 7.8, and 7.3-7.0 Ma. The three pulses account for nearly 44% of all turnover. Throughout the late Miocene, species richness declined steadily, and diversity and richness indices together with data on body size imply that community ecological structure changed abruptly just after 10 Ma, and then again at 7.8 Ma. Between 10 and 7.8 Ma the large-mammal assemblages were strongly dominated by equids, with more balanced faunas before and after. The pattern of appearance and disappearance is selective with respect to inferred habits of the animals. Species appearing after 9.0 Ma are grazers or typical of more open habitats, whereas many species that disappear can be linked to more closed vegetation. We presume exceptions to this pattern were animals of the mixed C-3/C-4 communities or the wetter parts of the floodplain that did not persist into the latest Miocene. The pace of extinction accelerates once there is C-4 vegetation on the floodplain.
   The 10.3 Ma event primarily comprises disappearance of taxa that were both common and of long duration. The event does not correlate to any obvious local environmental or climatic event, and the pattern of species disappearance and appearance suggests that biotic interactions may have been more important than environmental change. The 7.8 Ma event is characterized solely by appearances, and that at 7.3 Ma by a combination of appearances and disappearances. These two latest Miocene events include more taxa that were shorter ranging and less common, a difference of mode that developed between approximately 9.0 and 8.5 Ma when many short-ranging and rare species began to make appearances. Both events also show a close temporal correlation to changes in floodplain deposition and vegetation.
   The 7.8 Ma event follows the widespread appearance of C-4 vegetation and is coincident with the shift from equid-dominated to more evenly balanced large-mammal assemblages, The 7.3 to 7.0 Ma event starts with the first occurrence of C-4-dominated floras and ends with the last occurrence of C dominated vegetation. Absence of a consistent relationship between depositional facies and the composition of faunal assemblages leads us to reject fluvial system dynamics as a major cause of faunal change. The close correlation of latest Miocene species turnover and ecological change to expansion of C-4 plants on the floodplain, in association with oxygen isotopic and sedimentological evidence for increasingly drier and more seasonal climates, causes us to favor explanations based on climatic change for both latest Miocene pulses.
   The Siwalik record supports neither "coordinated stasis" nor "turnover pulse" evolutionary models. The brief, irregularly spaced pulses of high turnover are characteristic of both the Stasis and pulse models, but the high level of background turnover that eliminates 65-70% of the initial species shows there is no stasis in the Siwalik record. In addition, the steadily declining species richness and abrupt, uncoordinated changes in diversity do not fit either model.

AB The alteration of a habitat such as that caused by the introduction of exotic animal species that displace the native ones, reducing their populations or leading them to extinction, can result in the disruption of species interactions which may have evolved during millions of years. The insular ecosystems are especially vulnerable to such disturbances, as they are usually less complex and have a lower number of species than the continental ones. In the present work I document the consequences of the disruption of plant-disperser interactions, caused by the introduction of carnivorous manimals in the Balearic Islands, for the populations of two shrub species: Cneorum tricoccon L., with a distribution restricted to the western Mediterranean, and Daphne rodriguezii Texidor, endemic from Menorca island. Whereas carnivores have "replaced" the native dispersers (lizards) of the former, notably modifying its distribution -especially in Mallorca-, the plant-lizard mutualism disruption seems to have been dramatic for the second species, drastically reducing its populations except in an islet where lizards still persist.

AB Coral assemblages are generally open to immigration from regional species pools and thus are regionally enriched rather than saturated with species. Previously we have documented the sensitivity of local richness in these assemblages to a number of regional factors including the size of the regional species pool. Here we focus on the local scale used to determine the local-regional richness relationship. We examine the sensitivity of local richness to regional richness and to two environmental variables (depth and habitat type) across a range of locality Sizes. In general, local richness is sensitive to the environmental variables regardless of locality size. In contrast, it is relatively insensitive to regional richness in very small 1-m(2) quadrats but highly sensitive when sampled with 10-m line transects. Thus our analysis suggests a spatial threshold somewhere below 10 m for the detection of regional enrichment in coral assemblages. There are four biological mechanisms that may allow regional effects to be expressed at this spatial resolution: (1) disturbance and slow recovery toward competitive equilibrium, (2) heterogeneous biological interactions involving aggregated resources, neighborhood competition, or nonrandom dispersal among local neighborhoods, (3) spatially variable predation by specialists, and (4) probabilistic recruitment coupled with equal competitive ability. Empirical tests are now needed to discriminate among these mechanisms.

AB The species pool concept has been used as a theoretical framework for understanding local community richness. A significant problem in putting the concept into practice is the lack of methods for determining the size of the species pool. We tested the hypothesis that species composition of recent forests is primarily determined by the species composition of neighbouring older forests against the null-hypothesis that species are a random sample of the species occurring in the study area. Forest plant species composition of recently established fragments was significantly correlated with species composition in neighbouring older forests (i.e. the local species pool). When older forest within a neighbourhood of 1000m radius is considered, seed dispersal sources can be found for 91% of the flora in the recent forests. For an individual fragment, dispersal is a much more important determinant of species presence than the environment, with an average of 46% of the total pool excluded from local pools by dispersal limitation and only 8% excluded by environmental limitations. The species richness of recent forests is on average 23% of the local species pool. Several hypotheses are proposed for this low percentage, such as asymmetric competition due to the early successional state or the limited colonization period.

AB Evidence is presented for the occurrence of alternative stable states in a wet calcareous dune slack on the Frisian island of Texel, The Netherlands. An early pioneer stage (0.5 ka m(-2) total standing crop) and a more productive later successional stage (2.9 kg m(-2)) occur side by side, with sharp boundaries between them. The pioneer vegetation has been recorded at the site for more than 62 yr. These features indicate the occurrence of a positive-feedback mechanism that has led to alternative stable states.
   Analyses of ground and surface water composition, and decalcification depths, indicated that hydrologically the study site can be characterized as a flow-through slack, with exfiltration of calcareous groundwater on one side and infiltration of surface water on the other side of the slack. These differences in hydrological conditions have led to distinct differences in environmental conditions within the dune slack. The occurrence of the two successional stages can, however, not be explained by differences in hydrological conditions since both stages occur side by side in the centre of the dune slack. It is, therefore, more likely that biotic interactions are the cause of the vegetation pattern. Three possible mechanisms for feedback processes are discussed: (1) enhanced nitrogen loss; (2) sulfide toxicity and (3) nutrient accumulation in internal cycle.

AB Uncovering why spatial mosaics of mimetic morphs are maintained in a Mullerian mimicry system has been a challenging issue in evolutionary biology. In this article, we analyze the reaction diffusion system that describes two-species Mullerian mimicry in one- and two-dimensional habitats. Due to positive frequency-dependent selection, a local population first approaches the state where one of the comimicking patterns predominates, which is followed by slow movement of boundaries where different patterns meet. We then analyze the interfacial dynamics of the boundaries to find whether a stable cline is maintained and to obtain the wave speed if the cline is unstable. The results are: (1) In a spatially uniform habitat the morph with greater base fitness spreads both in one and two species system. (2) The strength of cross-species interaction determines whether the mimetic morph clines of model and mimic species coalesce into the same geographical region or pass through each other. The joint wave speed of clines decreases by increasing the number of comimicking species in the mimicry ring. (3) In spatial heterogeneous habitats, stable clines can be maintained due to the balance between the base fitness gradient and the biased gene flow by negative curvature of boundary. This allows the persistence of a spatial mosaic even if one of the morphs is in every place advantageous over the other. A balanced cline is also maintained if there is a gradient in the population density. (4) A new advantageous morph occurring at a local region is doomed to go to extinction in a finite time if the "radius" of initial distribution is below a threshold. Possible applications to the heliconiine butterfly mimicry ring, heterozygous disadvantage systems of chromosomal rearrangement and hybrid zone, the third phase of Wright's Shifting Balance theory, and cytoplasmic incompatibility are discussed.

AB Fffects of climatic warming on plants are likely to be different for different species, with consequences for interactions between species, changes in community structure and interactions between different communities. This study reports the effects of increased temperature and N addition on heather, an extensive and important species in the uplands of NW Europe, and bracken, a species of global importance, often regarded as a weed. Air temperature was increased by up to 0.83 degreesC using open-topped polythene tents, and additional N was provided as NH4NO3 at a rate of 50 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), at a field site in Upper Teesdale in northern England, both in pure canopies, and at the boundary between the species.
   Biomass of deciduous bracken fronds, with its relatively fast within-year response potential, was significantly increased by higher growing temperatures, while biomass of the perennial rhizomes, which represent growth over a number of years, was not altered after three years. Additional N had little effect, possibly due to the high efficiency with which bracken recycles nutrients. Overall, bracken is likely to benefit from the currently rising temperatures in Britain. Direct effects of the temperature and N treatments on heather were small: heather in the pure canopy responded only marginally to the treatments. However, it showed considerable reductions in vigour in the boundary plots. The results highlight the importance of the biological environment in perturbation experiments. We conclude that heather will probably be further displaced by bracken in a warmer climate. In the third year of the study albedo was much higher over bracken than over heather dominated areas. This means that if there are shifts in the boundary between them due to climate change, there is a potential for the modification of feedbacks to climate change, but the magnitude depends on a number of competing processes.

AB Manipulative field experiments are used in ecology to study biotic interactions in populations and communities. In benthic suspension-feeding organisms, these interactions can occur over multiple spatial scales, but this has rarely received experimental attention. A field experiment in Lake Waccamaw, North Carolina, USA, explored scale-dependent interactions in the freshwater mussels Elliptio waccamawensis and Leptodea ochracea (Bivalvia: Unionidae). Mussel density and patch size were manipulated in situ during summer 1996. Density treatments (Low: 32 monospecific individuals m(-2), High: 64 monospecific individuals m(-2), Mixed: 64 individuals m(-2) at a 1:1 ratio of the two species) were maintained in benthic enclosures (0.25 m(2)), and a scale treatment altered mussel patch size (Small-scale: 0.25 m(2), Large-scale: 3 m(2)). Large-scale patches were achieved by supplementing the area around each 0.25 m(2) enclosure with additional mussels. Bivalve shell growth, tissue weight, and shell weight were analyzed. E. waccamawensis did not respond to any of the treatments, including spatial scale. For L. ocbracea, shell growth and weight were not influenced by experimental treatments; however, average tissue weight of mussels in small patches (0.25 m(2)) was significantly higher in the High and Mixed treatments compared to the Low treatment. This positive effect was not observed in larger patches. These data provide evidence for scale-dependent interactions in unionids. In addition, they further an intriguing hypothesis linking spatial aggregation and reproductive success in freshwater mussels.

AB Research into the genetic basis of the ecological sophistication of plants is hampered by the availability of transformable systems with a wealth of well-described ecological interactions. We present an Agrobacterium-mediated transformation system for the model ecological expression system, Nicotiana attenuata, a native tobacco that occupies the post-fire niche in the Great Basin Desert of North America. We describe a transformation vector and a transformation procedure that differs from the standard cultivated tobacco transformation protocols in its use of selectable markers, explants, media and cultivation conditions. We illustrate its utility in the transformations with genes coding for key enzymes in the oxylipin cascade (lipoxygenase, allene oxide synthase, hydroperoxide lyase) in antisense orientations and present high-throughput screens useful for the detection of altered phenotypes for the oxylipin cascade (green leaf volatiles and jasmonic acid after wounding).

AB Issues of spatial scale are inherent in many ecological systems. This study uses a spatially explicit cellular automaton model to explore how the scale of dispersal interacts with the scale and strength of negative frequency dependence to determine patterns of species distribution. Counter to expectation., strong local frequency-dependent interactions result in random spatial patterns. When dispersal scale and interaction scale are decoupled, the resulting patterns are not necessarily random. For strong negative frequency dependence, stable bands result when the scale of interaction exceeds the scale of dispersal, and bands with two-point cycles result when the scale of dispersal exceeds the scale of interaction. However, for weaker interactions occurring over intermediate scales, only random patterns result. Thus, our results call into question the utility of inferring any ecological interaction from only the spatial distributions of the putatively interacting species. Furthermore. our results call for new experimental studies that explicitly manipulate the strength and the scale of the processes being studied.

AB Facilitation is important in structuring plant communities in harsh environments although most recent studies have been descriptive and focussed on adult plant interactions. Here, we test for facilitative effects by seeds and seedlings of Erodium laciniatum and Erucaria pinnata on the emergence and subsequent community structure from an annual plant seed bank in the Negev desert, Israel. We specifically test whether (i) the addition of seeds or seedlings of these species increases emergence from the seed bank. (ii) the addition of seeds or seedlings increases final plant community performance, and (iii) the effect of each species is specific. Both Erodium seeds and seedlings acted as a benefactor for the rest of the plant community by increasing density and biomass of the plants germinated from the seed bank. Erodium seedlings, had a stronger positive effect than seeds early in the growing season. Erucaria (seeds and seedlings) did not influence the plant Community. This suggests that species interactions are specific and that interactions between seeds and between plants and seeds can influence community structure.

AB Investigations of European floodplain rivers demonstrate how landscape ecology can provide an effective framework to integrate pattern and process in river corridors, to examine environmental dynamics and interactive pathways between landscape elements, and to develop viable strategies for river conservation. The highly complex and dynamic nature of intact river corridors is particularly amenable to a landscape ecology perspective. Analysis of spatial patterns has provided considerable insight into environmental heterogeneity across river corridors and is an essential prelude to examining dynamic interactions. For example, data from aerial photographs, digitized maps and year-round field measurements in a glacial flood plain, enabled us to distinguish six channel types, based on the correspondence between connectivity and physicochemical attributes. Spatial data were also used to analyze longitudinal changes in landscape elements along the course of a morphologically-intact riverine corridor, providing insight into the structural complexity that must have characterized many Alpine rivers in the pristine state. Landscape indices were employed to investigate seasonal dynamics in a glacial flood plain of the Swiss Alps which exhibits a predictable expansion/contraction cycle, with corresponding shifts in flow paths (surface and subsurface) and water sources (snowmelt, englacial, subglacial, alluvial aquifer, hillslope aquifer). Surface connectivity exhibited an unexpected biphasic relationship with total channel length, whereas riverscape diversity progressively increased along the entire range of channel length. Reconstituting the functional integrity that characterizes intact river corridors should perhaps be the major goal of river conservation initiatives. Although understanding functional processes at the landscape scale is essential in this regard, few data are available. In the Alluvial Zone National Park on the Austrian Danube, three phases of hydrological connectivity were identified (disconnection, seepage connection and surface connection) that corresponded to the predominance of three functional processes (biotic interactions, primary production and particulate transport) within the river corridor.

AB We determined changes in willow (Salix spp.) cover in two valleys of the eastern slope of Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado, USA, and related these changes to suspected causative factors. Changes in vegetation were inferred from digital maps generated from aerial photo-interpretation and field surveys conducted with a global positioning system. The decrease in riparian shrub cover was approximately 20% in both valleys over the period between 1937/46 and 1996, while the decline in tall willow (>2 m tall) cover was estimated to be approximately 55% in both valleys. Suppressed willows (<1.5 m tall) were predominantly located in areas affected by flooding and in areas where major river reductions were observed. Both valleys had sites that were being colonized by willows in wet meadows, and open areas created by flood disturbance. The potential causes of willow decline are many. Willow decline was associated with simplification of river spatial pattern, i.e., less complex branching and channelization, and a large flood disturbance. The causes of the reduction in river meanders were not determined, but are likely related to a decline in beavers, an increase in elk, and, possibly climate change. An increase in elk placed increased browsing pressure on willow during the period of the willow decline. Other factors such as climate changes and human activities could have also contributed to the willow decline. The persistence of these riparian ecosystems depends in large part on biotic interactions, particularly between willow, beaver, and elk.

AB In this study we assessed the impact of the spatial scale of analysis on patterns of latitudinal diversity of rocky intertidal invertebrates and on the relationship between local and regional species richness. Fifty-three wave-exposed sites were sampled along the coast of Chile between 18degrees40'S and 42degrees35'S, covering a range of over 2600 km and 25degrees of latitude. Three spatial scales were defined to analyze latitudinal trends of diversity: (1) regional, based on species range limits across the entire region (100s of km), (2) site, corresponding to hundreds of square meters sampled at each location, (3) sampling unit scale, corresponding roughly with a square meter of rocky shore. The analysis showed that spatial patterns of species richness and species turnover varied according to the scale used. At a regional scale, species richness showed a mid-latitudinal peak (i.e. around 30 to 32degreesS), decreasing toward northern and southern latitudes. No clear latitudinal trends in diversity were detected at site and especially at sampling unit scales. Despite the fact that at regional scale species turnover was low and geographically uniform, at the site scale beta diversity showed the existence of 2 zones of higher species turnover (19 to 20degreesS and 30 to 32 S), which may be attributed to changes in ecological and oceanographical regimes. The relationship between regional and local species richness changed depending on the 'local' scale used; unsaturated patterns (linear positive relationship between local and regional diversity) were evident at site scale, whereas saturated patterns (quadratic trend between local and regional diversity) were observed when the local scale was defined in terms of the sampling unit. We suggest that different regulating processes, operating at different spatial scales, may explain the latitudinal trends in diversity at site and sampling unit scales. While regional processes may set an upper limit in species richness at site scale, species interactions (e.g. competition) may control species richness at sampling unit scales. These findings question the current idea of the disproportionate prevalence of regional factors over local ones in determining diversity of local assemblages. They also suggest that regulation of local diversity results from the interplay of regional and local processes.

AB Aggregations of wild fish were counted around 9 floating sea-cage fish farms along a 300 km stretch of the Spanish coastline in the south-western Mediterranean Sea, Each fish farm cultivated Sparus aurata and Dicentrarchus labrax in 6 to 16 floating sea cages between 10 m and 7.4 km from the coast. During September and October 2001, assemblages of fish were counted on 3 separate days at each of 9 farms. Six 5 min rapid visual counts using SCUBA and covering 11250 m(3) were performed within each farm complex and at open water control sites 200 m distant from farms. Abundance (52 to 2837x), biomass (2.8 to 1126x) and number of species (1.6 to 14x) were greater in fish farm counts than control counts at all locations. Twenty-seven species were recorded at fish farms, with 2 families, Sparidae (12 species) and Carangidae (4 species), being particularly abundant. Over 85% of farm-associated fish were of adult size. Assemblages of wild fish differed greatly between farms separated by 10s to 100s of km, although there was some evidence to suggest that similar assemblages occur at farms separated by 100s of m to several km. Abundance, biomass and number of species differed among fish farms, with all 3 variables negatively correlated with distance of farms from shore and positively correlated with size of farms. Limited variability of wild fish assemblages and abundance of the dominant taxa at each farm among times sampled indicated some degree of temporal stability on a scale of several weeks. Due to the strong aggregative effect of fish farms, possible residence of fishes for periods of weeks to months and the prohibition of fishing within farm leasehold areas, we suggest that coastal sea-cage fish farms may act as small (up to 160 000 m(2)), pelagic marine protected areas (MPAs). Furthermore, at farms where wild fish are abundant, ecological interactions that may influence both wild fish stocks and the impact of farms must be considered.

AB Dolphins and sharks feed at times on the same food; however, the influence of these interactions on the feeding success of either predator has not been measured. I employed underwater video to record bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus and silky sharks Carcharhinus falciformis feeding on the same school of fish, and for the first time measured food intake of free-ranging dolphins. Regression analyses showed that dolphin food intake diminished as the number of feeding sharks increased, but was unrelated to the number of dolphins feeding, side of the prey clump or duration of feeding events. The number of dolphins increased at the beginning of a feeding event in the presence of sharks but not in their absence. This increase apparently provided a benefit to dolphins since the number of sharks feeding was negatively related to the number of dolphins feeding. Other studies have indicated that risk of shark predation influences dolphin group size and habitat use. This study indicates that interspecific contests over food influence dolphin food intake and perhaps also dolphin group size.

AB More recent and extensive food web studies have questioned some of the prevailing paradigms of food web theory. Yet with few exceptions, most food webs and associated metrics are reported for freshwater or terrestrial systems. I analyzed the food web of the Northeast US Shelf ecosystem across a large spatial and temporal extent. This speciose food web exhibits a predator:prey ratio (0.95) and percentage of intermediate species (89%) similar to most other food webs. Other statistics, such as the percentage of omnivory (62%), percentage of cannibalistic species (31%), number of cycles (5%), and the total number of links (L; 1562) and species (S; 81) are similar to more recent and extensively studied food webs. Finally, this food web exhibits a linkage density (L/S; 19.3), connectivity (C; 48.2%), and Lyapunov stability proxy (S x C; 39.1) that are an order of magnitude higher than other webs or are disproportionate to the number of species observed in this system. Although the exact S and C relationship is contentious, the connectivity of food webs with more than 40 species is approximately 10%, which is very different from the near 50% observed for this ecosystem. The openness of marine ecosystems, lack of specialists, long lifespans, and large size changes across the life histories of many marine species can collectively make marine food webs more highly connected than their terrestrial and freshwater counterparts, contrary to food web theory. Changes in connectivity also have ramifications for ecosystem functioning and Lyapunov stability. The high connectivity of this food web and the mathematical determinants for stability are consistent with the weak nature of species interactions that have been observed and that are required for system persistence, Yet the historically high exploitation rates-of marine organisms obfuscate our understanding of marine food web stability. It is possible that marine food webs are inherently very different from their terrestrial or freshwater counterparts, implying the need for modified paradigms of food web theory.

AB A soft-shelled non-indigenous clam, Nuttallia obscurata, has invaded coastal soft-sediment habitats of the northeastern Pacific. In a survey of 35 sites within the San Juan Islands, Washington, USA, Nuttallia was found almost exclusively in sandy substrates, higher in the intertidal than most native clams (>1 m above mean lower low water). The distinctive distribution of Nuttallia suggested that tidal height and sediment composition may be important physical factors that control its refuge availability, regulating its exposure to predation and ultimately the success of its invasion. I tethered Nuttallia for 24 h in the high intertidal where it is typically found and in the low intertidal at an elevation where it was never found. Clams restrained to the surface suffered high mortality from crab predation at both tidal heights, whereas control clams with unrestricted burrowing movement exhibited high mortality rates only in the low intertidal. In a second experiment, I transplanted sediment within and between the two intertidal heights to measure effects of tidal height and sediment type on survival and burial depth of Nuttallia. At both tidal heights all clams placed on mud-cobble substrate, naturally common in the low intertidal, suffered high mortality rates (> 60% in 24 h). Nuttallia on loosely packed sand substrate, naturally found in the upper intertidal, survived much better, however, because they buried deeper than in the tightly packed mud. Caged control clams at both tidal heights suffered no mortality. Apparently native predators are mitigating community level impacts of an invader by excluding Nuttallia completely from some beaches with improper sediment characteristics or relegating it in others to a zone not often inhabited by native species, thereby reducing potential competitive interactions. These findings show that a physical habitat characteristic can mediate biotic resistance to an invader and thus control invasion success and community-level impacts. Generally, such physical-biological interactions may explain some of the reported site-to-site variability in invasion Success, as well as the patchy distribution of many soft-sediment infaunal species.

AB Geographically varying rodent dynamics may be due to specific landscape effects or to regional variation. Two common vole species (Clethrionomys glareolus and Microtus agrestis), their main predators and their impact on some important food items were monitored in Sweden on forest clearcuts in two different landscape types, situated in two different regions with different climatic conditions. Censuses, with 10-16 clearcuts in each landscape and both landscapes in the two regions, were designed to permit analyses of variance of the effects of landscape composition and region on dynamics and species interactions. Region had a far greater influence than landscape on vole numbers, on the proportions of generalist and specialist predators and on the winter browsing of bark of indigenous and experimental woody plants as well on seed consumption in experimental supplies. The findings indicated an influence of the depth and quality of the snow cover on the predation rates by generalist and specialist predators. However, there were also clear signs of food limitation in the snow-rich areas. Such areas had fewer generalist predators, which probably meant less directly density-dependent predation. Thus, lack of high-quality food may put a brake on population growth in climatically harsh regions, permitting increasing populations of specialist predators such as small mustelids to subsequently over-utilise their main prey and potentially cause prolonged low densities. Snow conditions may affect numbers and interactions both within habitats, landscapes and regions. Thus, to more fully understand rodent dynamics, small-scale movements and interactions of individuals in relation to the main large-scale factor(s) of various regions need to be examined.

AB The Galapagos Islands harbor some of the least impacted marine ecosystems in the tropics, but there are indications that local artisanal fishing is affecting exploited marine communities. To quantify these effects, I sampled communities of fishes and sea urchins at a number of heavily fished and lightly fished sites throughout the central islands of the archipelago, Sites were selected based on information collected as part of a local fisheries monitoring study and standardized across a number of abiotic factors. Abundance and biomass of the primary target species were significantly lower in the heavily fished sites than in the lightly fished sites, Community structure also differed between heavily and lightly fished sites. Cluster analyses of the full community of fishes and a subset of nontarget fishes revealed that sites within a treatment were more similar to one another than sites between treatments. Herbivorous fishes tended to be lower in abundance and sea urchins tended to be higher in abundance in heavily fished sites, but these differences were not significant. My results are encouraging in that the direct effects of artisanal fishing are limited to the primary target species, which probably results from a high specificity of fishing gear. The differences in community structure, however, suggest that artisanal fishing also has cascading effects on noncommercial species throughout the community An improved understanding of important ecological interactions, increased ecological and fishery monitoring, and effective precautionary management are needed to ensure that human effects in these waters remain minimal.

AB In arid and semiarid environments, isolated vegetative patches establish islands of fertility in which facilitation is a dominant interaction between plant species. These patches may provide favorable microsites for revegetation with desirable species in areas where traditional revegetation procedures fail. Alpha grass (Stipa tenacissima) steppes are widely distributed within the semiarid areas of southern Europe and northern Africa and represent a degraded stage of climax vegetation. In this study, we analyzed the effects of S. tenacissima tussocks on the survival, growth, and ecophysiological features of experimentally planted seedlings of Medicago arborea, Quercus coccifera, and Pistacia lentiscus in three sites in a semiarid region in southeastern Spain. Our main objective was to test whether S. tenacissima was able to facilitate shrub establishment in semiarid degraded steppes.
   Soils under S. tenacissima tussocks had higher organic matter content and water availability than those from open areas. Stipa tenacissima significantly reduced photosynthetically active radiation and soil temperature. One year after planting, shrub survival was significantly higher near S. tenacissima ("tussock" microsite) than on the open areas ("open" microsite). Predawn water potentials of the shrub seedlings measured before and after the summer were significantly higher in the tussock microsites, with differences ranging from 22% to 33% and from 17% to 38% before and after the summer, respectively. Leaf biomass for seedlings harvested before and after the summer was significantly higher for seedlings planted on tussock microsites in comparison to the open microsites. Our results suggest a direct facilitative effect of S. tenacissima on introduced shrubs. This study indicates that positive interactions in semiarid steppes can be of particular importance for effective restoration in degraded semiarid ecosystems.

AB Cospeciation, in which both parties of an ecological interaction speciate in parallel with each other, has rarely been reported in biotic associations except the cases for host-parasite interaction. Many tropical plants house ants and thereby gain protection against herbivores. Although these ant-plant symbioses have been regarded as classical cases of coevolved mutualism, no evidence of cospeciation has been documented. The Asian ant-plant association between Crematogaster ants and Macaranga plants is highly species specific and the molecular phylogeny of the ants parallels the plant phylogeny, reflecting history of cospeciation. Evidence is presented that this association has been maintained over the past seven million years. Phylogeographic patterns of 27 ants from two Macaranga species suggest that allopatric cospeciations are still in progress in Asian wet tropics.

AB Ecological complexity of species interactions and habitat heterogeneity creates and maintains biodiversity at a trophic level in an ecosystem. This biodiversity simultaneously serves as raw material on which selective forces for organizing ecosystems operate. As a result of this organization process, differences in structure and functioning of ecosystems (diversity at ecosystem level) are generated. Although understanding diversity at the ecosystem level has attracted great interest, recent theoretical advances toward this aim have not been fully appreciated yet. Following Higashi et al. (1993), this report presents a theoretical framework that deals with the organization process of an ecosystem as a consequence of the interactions among its biotic components and their modification of ecological traits, Specifically, the ecosystem organization process of a terrestrial ecosystem is analyzed, including primary producers and decomposers. This model sheds new insight into the differences between temperate and tropical forest ecosystems.

AB Arthrocnemum macrostachyum is a perennial species acting as a primary colonizer of salt pans in Mediterranean high salt marshes. Salicornia ramosissima, an annual, occurs in salt pans under Arthrocnemum canopies and in open areas. The aim of this study was to analyse, in wild populations and a transplant experiment, how S. ramosissima population dynamics and growth are affected by A. macrostachyum. The environmental conditions within the patches of Arthrocnemum were less stressful than in the open areas, with lower radiation levels and salinity concentrations. In the inner areas of A. macrostachyum patches, density-dependent mortality processes of S. ramosissima seedlings led to low densities of adult individuals with greater morphological development and reproductive success than in open areas. However, at the edges of Arthrocnemum patches facilitation of seedling survival favoured high densities. Environmental stress hindered development, decreased reproduction and premature death. These results are in agreement with the general theory of factors controlling vegetation distribution that biotic interactions dominate in low stress environments, while abiotic interactions dominate under harsher environmental conditions. A. macrostachyum plays an essential role in the succession in these salt pans, facilitating seed production and stimulating nucleation processes in S. ramosissima.

AB A small-scale field study was conducted to explain seedling emergence and recruitment of reproductive individuals in a four-year-old Mediterranean annual plant community. The analyzed levels were populations, functional types, and total number of individuals in the community. We hypothesized that the number of germinable seeds positively affects the number of emerged seedlings which positively affects the number of reproductive individuals. We hypothesized as well that litter mass, biomass of established adults, and number of non-conspecific emerged seedlings negatively affect the numbers of emerged seedlings and reproductive individuals. The results supported our multivariate causal explanation of plant recruitment, although concordances with the initial hypotheses were more frequent at the community level. The effect of the number of germinable seeds on the number of emerged seedlings was found to be robust only at the community level. At the population level, this relationship did not have a consistent tendency and depended on species identity and range of seed density experienced. Litter had negative effects on total number of individuals in the community, and usually non-significant effects at the population level. Litter effects were found to be inversely related to seed mass, and sharper cotyledons did not improve seedling emergence likely by favoring litter mat penetration. Interactions among plant species appeared not to have any effect on seedling emergence and survival, and had positive effects on certain populations. Biomass of established adult plants exerted no influence on seedling emergence and survival, probably due to their low abundance in this community during the germination period. Results permitted the inference of the main stages in the recruitment process and causal factors. They provided evidence for the greater importance of germination and emergence in comparison with seedling survival to insure reproductive recruitment in this community.

AB The composition, richness, diversity, abundance and dominance in infracommunities of metazoan parasites found in 86 croaker Cilus gilberti (Abbott 1889) are compared between two samples taken off Talcahuano, Chile, with 15 years of difference. All hosts harboured parasites, and 26 taxa were collected. The prevalence of all taxa, and the abundance of 22 taxa were recorded. Most (69%) taxa were found in both years. However, to compare between years, we just considered those 13 taxa occurring in at least 10 host individuals. Significant variations in composition but not in richness, abundance, diversity and dominance were found when infracommunities collected from croaker of similar body length were compared between years. Despite the fact that there are few antecedents on the subject, these results are similar to those reported in infracommunities of metazoan parasites of fishes and mammals in that there is high compositional variability and low aggregate variability. The extent to which this can be interpreted as indicating community compensation or stasis is discussed, considering that biological interactions could also be responsible for the observed pattern.

AB GETLAUS is a discrete and deterministic model for simulating cereal aphid population dynamics in dependence on antagonists. The complexity of the model was gradually increased, and the features for assessing biological and ecological relationships were expanded. The latest version, GETLAUS01, contains submodels for wheat, cereal aphids (Sitobion avenae, Rhopalosiphum padi, Metopolophium dirhodum), coccinellids (Coccinella 7 punctata, Propylea 14-punctcata) and syrphids, model units for chrysopids, carabids, staphylinids and spiders, and algorithms for parasitization, moulding, pesticide effects on aphids and antagonists and yield losses. Simulations are started by entering aphid and antagonist population densities (individuals per m(2)) measured at BBCH b9 (end of wheat flowering). The programme then describes their subsequent abundance development as influenced by biotic interactions, temperature, rainfall and wheat development. This paper gives a detailed account of the current version of the simulation model. The model vas used to study and demonstrate tri-trophic interactions, particularly aphid population dynamics influenced by antagonists under different natural and man-made conditions, but not to predict future aphid infestation. Findings based on simulation results obtained using field data will be presented and limitations in calculating predator occurrence and their effects will be discussed. The GETLAUS simulation model has proved to be a suitable tool for obtaining information on the mechanisms and dimensions of natural control. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Within any particular landscape. patch structure and dynamics likely will differ among habitat types because of environmental differences influencing the intensity and outcome of biological interactions. We compared the dynamics of natural and experimentally constructed mussel patches (Mytilus trossulus and M. edulis) in two intertidal habitats, tidepools and emergent rock, over a time series (5, 10, 15 mo) and among seasons (three successive 5-mo intervals). In tidepools, mussels naturally occurred in small patches (median < 25 cm(2)). In contrast, mussels on emergent rock formed extensive beds with decimeter-scale gaps., but these beds start as small patches following disturbance such as ice scour. For our experimental patches (15 cm(2)) in both habitats, we assessed the relative importance of physical (wave disturbance) and biological (predation, growth, recruitment, and immigration) processes in determining patch size and structure. Although individual experimental and natural patches varied greatly in size over time, mean patch area remained relatively constant. In general, mean size of individuals in experimental patches decreased due to the loss of larger mussels while numbers increased due to recruitment. Wave disturbance, which removes and redistributes mussels, appeared to be more important than predation (by the whelk Nucella lapillus) in determining patch structure and dynamics on this shore, although losses due to either process did not differ consistently between habitats over time. Individual growth rates were low (shell length less than or equal to0.4 mm/mo) but greater in tidepools than on emergent rock, whereas recruitment and immigration rates generally did not differ between habitats. Although each process contributed to changes in patch size and structure, collectively they did not result in a marked divergence in mean patch area or biomass between tidepools and emergent rock over the 15-mo experiment. We suggest that the broad patterns of distribution and abundance of mussels develop slowly on this shore largely because of low individual growth rates. Over time scales of years, however, positive relationships between individual growth and recruitment rates and patch size may accelerate the expansion of aggregations on emergent rock. Mussel assemblages at our site differ from those examined in many other studies in terms of the relative importance of wave dislodgment and predation as causes of loss and in the role of growth in offsetting these losses, This study shows how integrative approaches, with monitoring of patches and individuals within patches, can provide detailed mechanistic understanding of patch structure and dynamics.

AB An important goal in ecology is to discern under what habitat conditions community structure is primarily regulated by local ecological interactions and under what conditions community structure is more regulated by the pool of available colonists. I conducted a seed addition experiment in successional grassland to evaluate the relative significance of neighbourhood biotic interactions and propagule availability in regulating plant colonization and species richness along a natural gradient of grassland productivity. In undisturbed field plots, seed additions of 34 species led to an increase in species richness in locations of low productivity, an effect that declined in magnitude as productivity increased. In disturbed plots, seed additions led to a relatively constant increase in species richness at all levels of productivity. The results support the hypothesis that the role of propagule availability in regulating colonization dynamics and species richness declines in significance relative to local-scale competitive interactions as habitat productivity increases.

AB Many ecological interactions that are called mutualistic are in fact mixtures of antagonistic and mutualistic aspects. For example, plasmids exploit their bacterial hosts but also protect them against external threats. In this study, we analyse the conditions for the evolution of what we call 'dangerous liaisons': interactions combining mutualistic and antagonistic aspects. Starting point of our analysis is a model that was proposed as early as 1934. In this model, partners have to form a complex (either temporary or long lasting) in order to interact. Using this model framework we then set out to define and tease apart private interests of the interacting partners from their common good. This dichotomy provides a unifying perspective to classify ecological interactions. We discuss some examples to illustrate how the outcome of the interaction may depend on densities or on other contextual variables. Finally, we note that having a common good is not a necessary condition for partners to have aligned interests. In a dangerous liaison partners may have interest to cooperate even when this does not bolster the common good.

AB We conducted a short-term microcosm experiment to study the direct and indirect effects of a bacterivore on bacteria and the dynamics of two species of green algae. We introduced Scenedesmus, Chlorella and Colpidium, a bacterivorous ciliate, successively in a carbon-rich medium. Bacteria were introduced with Scenedesmus, Chlorella and Colpidium. The experiment lasted 40 days, preventing us from detecting whether the populations had reached equilibrium. The bacterivore had a positive effect on both species of algae by limiting the abundance of bacteria. In absence of the bacterivore, bacteria did not exclude the two algal species, despite the high carbon:nutrient ratio of the medium. Unexpectedly, by the end of the experiment the bacterivore, declined in all microcosms. Also, Chlorella growth was impeded by the presence of Scenedesmus. These two observations might be explained by allelopathic interactions. Our experiment suggests that the functioning of such a simple community is far more complex than assumed in previous theoretical and experimental models. Studying the dynamics of the system, however, allowed us to disentangle species interactions.

AB A major empirical approach in community ecology is to describe the dynamics of a community by examining small subsets of species. Unfortunately, interaction modifications, which cause pair-wise interaction coefficients to depend on the presence or absence of additional species, can make it difficult to predict the overall dynamics of species within a community from experiments with pairs of species. In a similar fashion, one of the major approaches in evolutionary ecology has been to describe the likely evolutionary dynamics of a single species by focusing on the selection imposed by a limited number of other species within the community. However, recent work on diffuse coevolution indicates that selection pressures due to one species can change in the presence of other species. The magnitude of the difficulty that interaction modifications and diffuse coevolution present for predicting ecological and evolutionary dynamics is an unresolved question. Here we outline the similarities and differences between the two topics, discuss experimental and statistical approaches to studying them, and make predictions about when ecological interaction modifications are likely to cause diffuse coevolution. Since the currencies for interaction modifications are usually fitness components such as growth, fecundity, or survival, is it likely that these will translate into corresponding differences in the relative fitness of individuals or genotypes, and thus in general these two phenomena will occur together. We argue that community ecologists and evolutionary ecologists will both benefit from experiments that test for the effects of interaction modifications, and that studies of the mechanisms driving interaction modifications and diffuse coevolution (e.g., changes in behavior, nonlinear effects on shared resources, genetic covariances) will aid our progress in understanding the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of communities.

AB A synthesis of ecological data available for subterranean fishes throughout the world is presented, and comparatively analyzed in an evolutionary context. Methods of ecological research are described, and their potential and limitations for the study of hypogean fishes are discussed. Ecology of troglobitic (exclusively subterranean) fishes is discussed with focus on distribution areas, population densities and sizes, use of habitat and movements, life cycle and feeding. When data are available, these species are compared with their epigean relatives. Putative ecological autapomorphies of troglobitic fishes, including habitat change, adaptations to cope with food scarcity, and precocial lifestyles, are interpreted in ecological and evolutionary contexts. Species interactions among subterranean species, including cases of syntopy and predation are briefly analyzed. Non-troglobitic hypogean fishes, with their ecological importance and evolutionary role, are also addressed. Problems of classification of subterranean fishes according to the Schiner-Racovitza system (troglobites, troglophiles and trogloxenes) are discussed, and a scenario of evolution of subterranean populations is presented.

AB Understanding microbial food web dynamics is complicated by the multitude of competitive or interdependent trophic interactions involved in material and energy flow. Metabolic inhibitors can be used to gain information on the relative importance of trophic pathways by uncoupling selected microbial components and examining the net effect on ecosystem structure and function. A eukaryotic growth inhibitor (cycloheximide), a prokaryotic growth inhibitor (antibiotic mixture), and an inhibitor of photosynthesis (DCMU) were used to examine the trophodynamics of microbial communities from the tidal creek in North Inlet, a salt marsh estuary near Georgetown, South Carolina. Natural microbial communities were collected in the spring, summer, and fall after colonization onto polyurethane foam substrates deployed in the tidal creek. Bacterial abundance and productivity, heterotrophic ciliate and flagellate abundance, and phototrophic productivity, biomass, and biovolume were measured at five time points after inhibitor additions. The trophic responses of the estuarine microbial food web to metabolic inhibitors varied with season. In the summer, a close interdependency among phototrophs, bacteria, and protozoa was indicated, and the important influence of microzooplanktonic nutrient recycling was evident (i.e., a positive feedback loop). In the fall, phototroph and bacteria interactions were competitive rather than interdependent, and grazer nutrient regeneration did not appear to be an important regulatory factor for bacterial or phototrophic activities. The results indicate a seasonal shift in microbial food web structure and function in North Inlet, from a summer community characterized by microbial loop dynamics to a more linear trophic system in the fall. This study stresses the important role of microbial loops in driving primary and secondary production in estuaries such as North Inlet that are tidally dominated by fluctuations in nutrient supply and a summer phytoplankton bloom.

AB Most traditional "biodiversity" indices have an uncertain ecological interpretation, unfavourable sampling properties, and excessive data requirements. A new index of taxonomic distinctness (the average evolutionary distance between species in an assemblage) has many advantages over traditional measures, but its ecological interpretation remains unclear. We used published behavioural species data in conjunction with bird atlas data to quantify simple functional metrics (the fraction of species engaged in non-competitive interactions, and the average between-species disparity in habitat preferences) for breeding-bird assemblages in Europe and North America. We then analysed correlations of functional metrics with taxonomic distinctness and species richness, respectively. All functional metrics had weak, positive correlations with species richness. In contrast, correlations between functional metrics and taxonomic distinctness ranged from slightly negative to strongly positive, depending on the relative habitat heterogeneity, and on the resource involved in the between-species interaction. Strong positive correlations between taxonomic distinctness and the fraction of interactive species occurred for resources with few producer species per consumer species, and we suggest that taxonomic distinctness is consistently correlated with conservation worth. With its favourable sampling properties and data requirements, this taxonomic distinctness measure is a promising tool for biodiversity research and for environmental monitoring and management.

AB Because of their higher evolvability, sexuals may have an advantage relative to asexual organisms in a competitive environment with many biotic interactions. We tested this idea using sexual and apomictic Taraxacum, dandelions. Taraxacum seedlings were grown without competition and in different competing combinations in a greenhouse. Apomicts had more and longer leaves than sexuals, but the same dry weight at harvest as sexuals. Competition reduced growth to the same extent in both apomicts and sexuals. Therefore, we conclude that sexual dandelions are no superior competitors relative to apomicts, In Taraxacum, new apomictic lineages spin off from the sexual population with some unknown frequency. This may enable the apomictic community to keep up with the sexual population.

AB Genomic duplication through polyploidy has played a central role in generating the biodiversity of flowering plants. Nonetheless, how polyploidy shapes species interactions or the ecological dynamics of communities remains largely unknown. Here we provide evidence from a 4 year study demonstrating that the evolution of polyploidy has reshaped the interactions between a widespread plant and three species of phytophagous moths. Our results show that polyploidy has produced non-uniform effects, with polyploids less attacked by one insect species, but significantly more attacked by two other species. These results suggest that the evolution of plant polyploidy may not generally confer uniform resistance to multiple species of insect herbivores. In the absence of such a uniform release, the extreme evolutionary success of polyploid plants is probably due to factors other than escape from herbivory. Together, these results suggest that a primary consequence of plant polyploidy may be to shape the ecological structure of plant-insect interactions, thereby providing opportunities for diversification in both plant and insect taxa.

AB Evaluation of biotic interactions along geographic gradients reveals that pressure on plant populations by herbivores and pathogens increases as latitude decreases. and is accompanied by a parallel increase in the number and toxicity of alkaloid-bearing plants. We compared rhizome alkaloid content with plant reproductive and vegetative characters in Sanguinaria canadensis (Papaveraceae) along an elevational gradient over two growing seasons to ascertain 1) if alkaloid production in bloodroot varies among populations and systematically with elevation, and 2) if there exists a correlation between isoquinoline alkaloid, vegetative and reproductive production. In general, alkaloid content in bloodroot rhizomes declines with elevation, increases with rhizome water content, varies by site, and fluctuates seasonally with plant growth and reproduction. Alkaloid content was positively correlated with vegetative and reproductive effort with few exceptions. Analysis of total protopine and benzophenanthridine alkaloid concentrations revealed generally similar patterns as those of individual alkaloid concentrations, although significant differences did appear between individual alkaloid concentrations.

AB Studies of host-parasite interactions in birds have contributed greatly to our understanding of the evolution and ecology of disease. Here we employ molecular techniques to determine the incidence and study the host-specificity of parasitic trypanosomes in the African avifauna. We developed a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based diagnostic test that amplified the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene (SSU rRNA) of Trypanosoma from avian blood samples. This nested PCR assay complements and corroborates information obtained by the traditional method of blood smear analysis. The test was used to describe the incidence of trypanosomes in 479 host individuals representing 71 rainforest bird species from Cameroon, the Ivory Coast and Equatorial Guinea. Forty-two (59%) of these potential host species harboured trypanosomes and 189 individuals (35%) were infected. To examine host and geographical specificity, we examined the morphology and sequenced a portion of the SSU rRNA gene from representative trypanosomes drawn from different hosts and collecting locations. In traditional blood smear analyses we identified two trypanosome morphospecies, T. avium and T. everetti. Our molecular and morphological results were congruent in that these two morphospecies had highly divergent SSU rRNA sequences, but the molecular assay also identified cryptic variation in T. avium, in which we found seven closely allied haplotypes. The pattern of sequence diversity within T. avium provides evidence for widespread trypanosome mixing across avian host taxa and across geographical locations. For example, T. avium lineages with identical haplotypes infected birds from different families, whereas single host species were infected by T. avium lineages with different haplotypes. Furthermore, some conspecific hosts from geographically distant sampling locations were infected with the same trypanosome lineage, but other individuals from those locations harboured different trypanosome lineages. This apparent lack of host or geographical specificity may have important consequences for the evolutionary and ecological interactions between parasitic trypanosomes and their avian hosts.

AB Perturbations to the density of a species can be propagated to distant members of a food web via shifts in the density or the traits (i.e. behavior) of intermediary species. Predators with differing foraging modes may have different effects on prey behavior, and these effects may be transmitted differently through food webs. Here we test the hypothesis that shifts in the type of predator present in a food web indirectly affect the prey's resource independent of changes in the density of prey. We assessed the importance of predator identity in mediating the grazing effects of the freshwater snail Physa integra on its periphyton resources using field and mesocosm studies. Field observations showed that Physa used covered habitats more in ponds containing fish than in ponds containing crayfish or no predators at all. A field experiment confirmed that snail behavior depended on predator identity. Physa placed near caged pumpkinseed sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus) selected covered habitats, but Physa placed near caged crayfish (Orconectes rusticus) moved to the surface of the water. The effects of predator identity on periphtyon were then examined in a mesocosm experiment, using caged predators. Habitat use of Physa was similar to their habitat use in the field experiment. In the presence of caged sunfish, periphyton standing crop in covered habitats was reduced to 34% of the standing crop in the presence of crayfish. In contrast, periphyton in near-surface habitats was 110% higher in the presence of fish than in the presence of crayfish. Thus, the effects of predator identity on Physa behavior cascaded through the food web to affect the abundance and spatial distribution of periphyton.

AB Documenting the role of past interactions in the assembly of present communities has proven problematic. Colonization is a key process in community assembly that is both potentially driven by past interactions and amenable to experimental approaches. Colonization and oviposition by an aquatic beetle (Tropisternus lateralis) was assayed in the presence and absence of both 'harmless' and tactilely/visually isolated predatory fish (Lepomis gibbosus and L. macrochirus). Beetles avoided each treatment with fish when compared to fish-free experimental pools. Activity levels after colonization also differed significantly between adults in fish and fish-free tanks. Predator effects on species composition are typically ascribed to contemporary predation events; the presence of a strong avoidance response demonstrates that past species interactions affect present distributions and may play an important role in the ongoing assembly of contemporary communities. Documentation of such avoidance behavior in a growing number of species fundamentally alters our view of the processes affecting species distributions and the process of community assembly.

TI Results of a food addition experiment in a north-central Chile small
   mammal assemblage: evidence for the role of "bottom-up" factors

AB Since 1989, effects of biotic interactions including predation and herbivory have been examined in a replicated experimental study in a north-central Chilean semiarid thorn scrub community. Strong responses of small mammals and plants to El Nino Southern Oscillations (ENSO) have also been documented suggesting that "bottom-up" factors related to high rainfall are important. To simulate increased primary productivity effects on small mammals, ad lib rabbit pellet additions were initiated in mid-1997 on unfenced grids near the experimental complex. Following the 1997 El Nino event with three times normal precipitation, numbers of small mammals during pre-addition months and the first treatment year were similar on control and food addition grids. During the second year (1998-1999), a period of severe drought, food additions had significant positive effects on numbers of two predominantly herbivorous "core" (resident) species, Octodon degus and Phyllotis darwini, and an omnivorous "quasi-core" (resident but highly fluctuating) species, Akodon olivaceus; however, all three species declined towards the end of the second treatment year, Two "opportunistic" (temporarily resident) species, Abrothrix longipilis (an insectivore) and Oligorvzomys longicaudatus (a granivore), showed no responses to food additions. An insectivorous marsupial, Thylamys elegans (also a "core species"), had significantly lower numbers on food addition grids. Changes in body weight distributions and proportions of reproductive individuals particularly in O. degus indicate in situ responses. Whereas no differences in residency, numbers of stations visited, and trappability were observed, energy compensation ratios greater than one suggest significant immigration in the second year. Thus, food additions elicited strong responses by herbivorous/omnivorous "core" and "quasi-core species" whereas they had no effects on "opportunistic species". These results reinforce the view that "bottom-up" factors influencing food availability exert prevailing control on numerically important small mammal species by temporarily increasing carrying capacity, and that "top-down" factors (i.e., biotic interactions) become important when small mammal numbers are at or near their carrying capacity, Spatial dynamics may be important in explaining declines of species populations exhibiting initially positive responses to food additions.

AB This study compared the distributions of ten species of Liolaemus lizards in the central Chilean Andes to the distributions of four types of parasites: malaria-causing Plasmodium, gut nematodes, ticks, and mites. We wanted to see if parasite numbers might be a factor in determining distributional limits of the lizards. We found that there was no evidence of malarial infestation of the lizards, that ticks were almost absent, that more often than not mite numbers decreased at the distributional limits of the lizards, and that gut nematodes -confined to the herbivorous lizards in our sample- may well be beneficial rather than detrimental. Rather than parasitism, other biotic interactions (e.g., predation or competition) are more likely candidates as factors influencing lizard elevational distributions, as are abiotic characteristics such as microhabitat availabilities and thermal factors.

AB In this study, we hypothesized that the primary variable determining species responses and interactions within wet/mesic riparian meadows in central Nevada, USA was the water table but that the direct and indirect effects of livestock grazing modified both species responses and interactions. We tested this hypothesis for two widespread riparian species, Carex nebrascensis and Poa pratensis ssp. pratensis, that co-occur but have maximum expression at different water tables. Carex nebrascensis has widely spread tillers typical of 'guerilla' plant architecture, while P. pratensis has closely spaced and compact tillers typical of 'phalanx' plant architecture. Individuals of both species were grown at mid- and low water tables with or without neighbors and were either clipped or not clipped at the end of the first growing season. For the study site with the most complete record, rnean water-table depth during the growing season (May through August) on the mid sites was -32 cm in year 1 and -7cm in year 2. Water-table depth on the low sites was -69 cm in year 1 and -31 cm in year 2. Plant survival tillering, biomass, and seed production over a 2-yr period were used to quantify the species responses. Water table had no effect on tillering or biomass of C nebrascensis, indicating that it is adapted for growth and persistence over the range of water tables examined. In contrast, growth and tillering of P. pratensis was severely restricted at more shallow water tables. Poa pratensis had about 50% fewer tillers and lower biomass (9.0 vs 46.5 g) for neighbor-removed plots on mid- than low-water-table sites at one of the study meadows. Further, tiller numbers of P. pratensis increased over time on the low-water-table plots, but decreased on the mid-water-table plots. Clipping had no effect on the survival, tillering, or growth of either species. The clipping treatment may not have removed sufficient leaf mass or may have been applied too near the end of the growing season to elicit a response. Neighborhood removal resulted in a 3- to 10-fold increase in tillering and higher plant mass (1.3 vs. 9.5 g) for C. nebrascensis. Poa pratensis showed an even greater response to neighbor removal. Tillering was 6-to 100-fold greater and mass was 15 to 50 times greater on neighbor removed than neighbor-intact plots. Comparisons between single species and mixed species plots indicated that there was an interaction between the species that limited tiller production in C. nebrascensis. These results indicate that P. pratensis, the 'phalanx' species, is capable of more rapidly responding to disturbances that remove neighbors and increase available space than C. nebrascensis, the 'guerilla' species. Contrary to previous studies, the interactions between the two species do not seem to be related to plant architecture and can be best attributed to generally greater growth rates and increased competitive ability for P. pratensis at lower water tables. Grazing may further alter the relative competitive ability of the two species in favor of P. pratensis.

AB We analysed the combined effects of pollination and seed predation on seed set of Centaurea jacea in 15 landscapes differing in structural complexity. In the centre of each landscape, a patch of Centaurea plants was established for standardized measurements of flower visitation, seed predation and seed set. Both the number of flower-visiting bees and the proportion of flower heads damaged by seed predators increased,,vith landscape complexity, which was measured as the proportion of semi-natural habitats. The mean number of seeds per flower head did not increase with the proportion of semi-natural habitats, presumably because of the counterbalancing effects of pollination and seed predation. For a subset of undamaged flower heads, the number of seeds per flower head was positively correlated with the number of flower visits. Further reasons for the unexpected failure to detect a correlation between landscape complexity and seed set appeared to be changes in flower-visitor behaviour and the contrasting responses of honeybees and wild bees to habitat context. Landscape analyses at eight spatial scales (radius of landscape sectors, 250-3000 m) showed that different groups perceived the landscape at different spatial scales. Changes in pollinator numbers could be explained only at small scales (up to 1000 m), while the seed predators also responded to large scales (up to 2500 m).

AB Efforts to ameliorate the negative effects of introduced predators on native species depend on a clear understanding of the complex interactions between predator and prey. We illustrate the necessity of considering size variation of predators and prey and antipredator responses of prey, using a case study of an endangered fish, June sucker (Chasmistes liorus) and an introduced predator, white bass (Morone chrysops). Using a mathematical model, we assessed vulnerability of young June suckers to predation by a growing cohort of white bass. Additionally, we experimentally evaluated whether young white bass selectively occupy vegetated habitats (in contrast to adults) similar to those occupied by young June suckers. June suckers are most vulnerable to young white bass immediately after they hatch and vulnerability declines thereafter. They are vulnerable for some period of time under all combinations of predator and prey growth rates. Young white bass selected vegetated habitats, and this response was increased in the presence of adult white bass. These data suggest that young white bass may be a significant source of mortality for small June suckers, contrary to previous assumptions. Results of this study inform conservation actions designed to decrease the effect of predation on small June suckers, such as potential effects of adding vegetated refuge habitats, possible effects of manipulation of spawning time, and the design of predator-free grow-out areas.

AB Previous studies indicate substantial variation in ecological responses to perturbation. In some cases, ecosystems are resilient to perturbation due to compensatory dynamics in which losses of sensitive species are offset by population increases of species that perform similar ecological functions. Here, we report a detailed evaluation of compensatory dynamics in zooplankton community responses to the experimental acidification of Little Rock Lake, Wisconsin, USA. We used a variance ratio to quantify compensatory dynamics in functional groups of zooplankton containing Species that use similar resources and are vulnerable to the same predators. We also used first-order autoregressive models to explore mechanisms driving the dynamics of each functional group, Our results indicate that responses of functional groups to acidification can be highly variable. Herbivorous copepods and medium-sized herbivorous cladocerans exhibited significant compensatory dynamics in response to acidification, whereas other functional groups, exhibited independent or synchronous dynamics. First-order autoregressive models indicated that groups exhibiting compensatory dynamics contained both acid-tolerant and acid-sensitive species that competed. In contrast, groups that contained only acid-sensitive or acid-tolerant species exhibited more independent or synchronous dynamics. Overall, our study highlights the combined roles of sensitivity to environmental perturbation and species interactions in determining the extent of compensatory dynamics in zooplankton functional group responses to acidification.

   ESTABLISHMENT
AB Most studies of density-dependent demography in plants consider the density only of the single focal species being studied. However, density-dependent regulation in plants may frequently occur at the level of the entire community, rather than only within particular species. In addition, because density dependence may differ considerably seven in direction) among demographic parameters, generalizing about patterns of density dependence and extrapolating to lifetime fitness and to population dynamics require comparisons among life history stages, as well as among types of species and physical environments.
   We constructed seminatural communities of desert annuals composed of all the constituent species in the same relative proportions as found in the natural habitat. These experimental communities were planted at a range of densities that extended far above and below mean natural field density. We compared among physical environments (irrigation treatments), among communities from different physical environments, and among growth forms (dicot and graminoid) to search for generalizations about the magnitude and direction of density dependence.
   Strong evidence of community-level density dependence was detected at all three life history stages studied in these desert annuals: emergence, survival, and final size, However, both the direction and degree of consistency of this density dependence varied considerably among the stages. The strongest and most consistent competitive effects were experienced at the emergence stage, where the mechanism is most likely a form of interference competition rather than exploitation competition. At the survival stage, the magnitude of effects was highly variable among physical environments and source communities but negative effects were relatively rare, with either positive or no significant effects of increasing density. Thus, exploitation competition was also unimportant at the survival stage. In contrast, for growth, exploitation competition appeared to be the primary mechanism of interaction influencing growth. This variation in mechanism, direction, and magnitude of interactions among life history stages suggests that current models of plant community structure that are based largely on exploitation competition as it influences growth (with mortality a simple function of growth) are inadequate for even this simple annual plant community.
   We also compared growth forms and found that graminoids were superior competitors to dicots at the emergence and survival stages; they also had higher emergence and survival, regardless of density. Consistent with this result, grasses are always the numerical dominants in the source communities. In contrast, the two growth forms did not differ in competitive ability for growth, and dicots were consistently larger individuals, independent of density, even though grasses were also usually the biomass dominants in the source communities. These results suggest the importance of nontrophic mechanisms of interaction in controlling community structure and again emphasize the importance of constructing and testing models that incorporate multiple mechanisms of interactions.

AB Introduced species represent major threats to native and natural biodiversity. On the other hand, biologists may increase the understanding of ecological interactions by following communities during establishment of exotic species. Accordingly, feeding ecology and habitat use were studied in native whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus) and recently invading vendace (C. albula) in two lake localities situated 50 km apart within the subarctic Pasvik River system, northern Norway and Russia. Whitefish originally dominated the native fish communities of both lakes. The recent invasion and successive downstream expansion of vendace allowed comparisons between two sites: one in which the influence of the new potential competitor on the native fish species was weak, and one in which the influence was strong. In the downstream lake vendace was recorded for the first time at the time of the study, and only in small numbers, whereas in the upstream lake vendace had established a high population density and was the dominant fish species in the pelagic zone. No vertical segregation in pelagic habitat use was found between the two fish species in either lake. In the downstream lake both whitefish and vendace fed exclusively on zooplankton and had almost identical diets. In the upstream lake. in contrast, whitefish fed predominantly on zoobenthos and surface insects, while vendace fed mainly on zooplankton. Thus. the strong presence of vendace as a specialized planktivore reduced the availability of zooplankton as prey for the more generalist whitefish. The food segregation between the two fish species in the upstream lake was apparently interactive and caused by a strong asymmetrical competition for zooplankton, vendace being the superior species. The ecological consequences (including reduced zooplankton size and species diversity, alteration of the pelagic food web, and eutrofication as a possible cascading effect on the primary production) of the vendace invasion in the Pasvik watercourse are considerable, even after a few years. and are likely to proceed and intensify in the future.

AB Predator-prey and other nonlinear ecological interactions often lead to oscillatory dynamics in temporal systems and in spatial systems when the rates of movement are large, so that individuals are effectively well mixed and space becomes unimportant. When individuals are not well mixed, however. properties of fluctuations in population densities, and in particular their amplitudes. are known to vary with the spatial scale at which the system is observed. We investigate the relationship among dynamics at different spatial scales with an individual-based predator-prey model that is stochastic and nonlinear. Results elucidate the role of spatial pattern and individual variability in the dynamics of densities. We show that spatial patterns in this system reduce the per capita rates of predation and prey growth but preserve functional forms. The functional forms remain those one would expect in a well-mixed system in which individuals interact according to mean population densities, but with modified parameters. This similarity of the functional forms allows us to approximate accurately the long-term dynamics of the spatial system at large scales with a temporal predator-prey model with only two variables, a simple system of ordinary differential equations of the type ecologists have been using for a long time. This approximation provides an explanation for the stabilizing role of space. the decrease in the amplitude of fluctuations from the well-mixed to the limited-movement case.
   We also provide an explanation for the previously described aperiodic dynamics of densities at intermediate spatial scales. These irregular cycles result from the interplay of demographic noise with decaying oscillations, where the decay of the cycles is due to the spatial patterns. It is indeed possible to capture essential properties of these cycles. including their apparent sensitivity to initial conditions, with a model that follows individuals but parameterizes their spatial interactions in a simple way, using again the similarity of functional forms and the modified parameters. Thus, demographic noise appears essential at a spatial scale previously chosen for the high degree of determinism in the dynamics.
   Our results illustrate a semi-empirical approach to simplify and to scale spatial ecological systems that are oscillatory from individual or local-scale to large-scale dynamics.

AB The fish community and habitat structure in the littoral zone of lakes Pedra and Hortencia, middle Rio Doce Valley, Brazil, were investigated in three sampling periods from August 1992 to May 1993. A total of 9106 fishes were collected, including 11 species in Lake Hortencia and 12 species in Lake Pedra. Diversity was higher in Lake Hortencia, although total fish abundance was the same for both lakes, with no significant temporal differences. The length distribution of the majority of fish species was similar between lakes. Geophagus brasiliensis was the dominant species (number/biomass) in all habitats of the two lakes in all three sampling periods. A striking difference in total fish abundance in relation to habitat types, which we attribute to physical variables, especially the abundance of macrophytes was observed. Negative impacts attributable to the local Eucalyptus sp. plantations were not detected in the fish community structure of Lake Hortencia, which is probably due to the maintenance of the riparian vegetation contributing to similar physical environmental conditions in the littoral zone and high similarity in fish community structure between the two lakes. However, further studies on fish community structure and potential Eucalyptus impacts are suggested as necessary to improve conservation measures of the lakes and their fish faunas.

AB Among individuals of a species, mean size in fishes increases with depth in the marine environment according to Heincke's Law. Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L.), like many young fish, are distributed in shallow ( <10 m) coastal water through much of their range as young juveniles (age 0) and deeper water as they grow. We tested the hypothesis that juvenile cod occupy such shallows to minimize risk of encounter with larger piscivorous fish whose mean size also increases with depth according to Heincke's Law. In day and night seining, we found that age-0 cod were most abundant in vegetated sites regardless of time period. In vegetated sites, age-0 cod abundance declined at night; the reverse was true at non-vegetated sites. Piscivorous fish were generally most abundant in vegetated sites; there were no consistent differences in abundance between day and night. Relative risk of predation of individual age-0 cod in different habitats, depths and times was determined by tethering. Age-0 cod prey were tethered 25 cm off the bottom in water 0.7, 1.5, 3, 6, 10 and 20 m deep; six times during the day, three times during dusk arid three times during the night in 25-min sets on eight dates in August and September 1998. A total of 576 tether sets were deployed. We deployed tethers on two dates for each of two vegetated-eelgrass, Zostera marina L.-and two unvegetated sites. Predation on tethered prey was lower at night than during day and dusk at all locations and depths. During day and dusk, predation increased with depth at all sites (<similar to>3 times higher in deep compared to shallow). At shallow locations (less than or equal to3 m), predation on tethered prey was generally higher in unvegetated compared to vegetated sites during the day and dusk. Predators were captured in 12% of sets. In order of frequency, these were: cunner Tautogolabrus adspersus Walbaum, Atlantic cod, and Greenland cod, G. ogac Richardson. Mean size of all predator species captured increased with depth. We showed that predation risk for juvenile fish increases with depth suggesting a behavioural antipredation mechanism for Heincke's Law. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study explores the determinants of distribution, abundance and regeneration of six Pinus species (P. halepensis, P. nigra, P. pinaster, P. pinea, P. sylvestris and P. uncinata) that occur naturally in Catalonia, northeastern Spain. The aim of this study was to generate accurate predictions of the distribution of each species using simple and readily available environmental variables. We used recursive partitioning and GIS analyses to relate the data base of 10600 field plots from the Forestry Inventory of Catalonia with abiotic and biotic characteristics of each plot. We present general patterns of distribution, dominance and regeneration for the six species and then focus on P. halepensis, the most abundant pine species in the western Mediterranean Basin. For all six species, the models correctly classified more than 80% of the distribution using abiotic factors, mainly altitude and rainfall variability. Biotic factors such as the basal area of other pine species were necessary to accurately predict patterns of pine species dominance. Biotic factors, especially the basal area of evergreen species (mainly Quercus ilex), were of overriding importance when predicting patterns of seedling occurrence. Potentially important factors such as land use and fire history were of little significance for predicting distribution at the scale of our study. Our models failed to predict accurately which species (and in which numbers) co-occur with P. halepensis. Factors not included in this study, such as stand age, disturbance (cutting, clearing) and other human-induced factors, are probably the main determinants of co-existence patterns.

AB The bark beetles Ips pini, I. perroti, and L grandicollis are sympatric in pine forests of the northcentral United States. They share the same limited phloem resource and often coexist within the same host trees. We tested whether phloem resources are partitioned in time and space by measuring spatial and seasonal colonization of logs. Differences among species in flight phenology, development time, voltinism, and spatial colonization patterns within logs reduce, but do not eliminate, species overlap. The bark beetle species share predation by Thanasimus dubius (Cleridae) and Platysoma cylindrica (Histeridae), which exploit pheromone signals for prey location. We employed pheromone traps to test for chemical communication among, bark beetle species. Heterospecific signals tend to be deterrents when they are added to conspecific signals but attractants when they are alone, indicating that the communication system can both reduce and increase species overlap in resource use depending upon relative abundance of the species. Deterrence by heterospecific signals is probably a result of selection for minimizing interspecific competition. However, individuals may sometimes benefit from joining aggregations of other species because of (1) predator swamping, (2) improved success in attacking live trees, and (3) location of suitable, recently dead, trees. These benefits should be greatest for males (which locate and colonize host trees before signalling females) and indeed males tended to be more attracted than females by heterospecific signals. Shared resources, shared predators, and heterospecific pheromone communication all contribute to species interactions in this guild of bark beetles, but predicting whether the removal of one species will tend to increase or decrease the abundance of remaining species remains difficult. Species interactions are likely conditional and coexistence is probably promoted by benefits to rare species of multispecies associations.

AB Soil fauna can influence soil processes through interactions with the microbial community. Due to the complexity of the functional roles of fauna and their effects on microbes, little consensus has been reached on the extent to which soil fauna can regulate microbial activities. We quantified soil microbial biomass and maximum growth rates in control and fauna-excluded treatments in dry and wet tropical forests and north- and south-facing subalpine forests to test whether soil fauna effects on microbes are different in tropical and subalpine forests. Exclusion of fauna was established by physically removing the soil macrofauna and applying naphthalene. The effect of naphthalene application on the biomass of microbes that mineralize salicylate was quantified using the substrate induced growth response method. We found that: (1) the exclusion of soil fauna resulted in a higher total microbial biomass and lower maximum growth rate in the subalpine forests, (2) soil fauna exclusion did not affect the microbial biomass and growth rate in the tropical forests, and (3) the microbial biomass of salicylate mineralizers was significantly enhanced in the fauna-exclusion treatment in the tropical wet and the south-facing subalpine forests. We conclude that non-target effects of naphthalene on the microbial community alone cannot explain the large differences in total microbial biomass found between control and fauna-excluded treatments in the subalpine forests. Soil fauna have relatively larger effects on the microbial activities in the subalpine forests than in tropical dry and wet forests.

AB Factors limiting tree invasion in the Inland Pampas of Argentina were studied by monitoring the establishment of four alien tree species in remnant grassland and cultivated forest stands. We tested whether disturbances facilitated tree seedling recruitment and survival once seeds of invaders were made available by hand sowing. Seed addition to grassland failed to produce seedlings of two study species, Ligustrum lucidum and Ulmus pumila, but did result in abundant recruitment of Gleditsia triacanthos and Prosopis caldenia. While emergence was sparse in intact grassland, seedling densities were significantly increased by canopy and soil disturbances. Longer-term surveys showed that only Gleditsia became successfully established in disturbed grassland. These results support the hypothesis that interference from herbaceous vegetation may play a significant role in slowing down tree invasion, whereas disturbances create microsites that can be exploited by invasive woody plants. Seed sowing in a Ligustrum forest promoted the emergence of all four study species in understorey and treefall gap conditions. Litter removal had species-specific effects on emergence and early seedling growth, but had little impact on survivorship. Seedlings emerging under the closed forest canopy died within a few months. In the treefall gap, recruits of Gleditsia and Prosopis survived the first year, but did not survive in the longer term after natural gap closure. The forest community thus appeared less susceptible to colonization by alien trees than the grassland. We conclude that tree invasion in this system is strongly limited by the availability of recruitment microsites and biotic interactions, as well as by dispersal from existing propagule sources.

AB Serpentine outcrops in northern California occur in a variety of configurations, from scattered small patches to extensive landscapes covering hundreds of square kilometers. These areas support a. distinctive flora with numerous uncommon or rare endemic species. I studied the reproductive ecology of two endemic plant species on large and small serpentine outcrops. The perennial herb, Calystegia collina, exhibited significantly lower reproductive success on small outcrops, partly because compatible pollen was not available from other, nearby populations. Local populations are more likely to produce seeds, and therefore potential colonists, when they occur in clusters of populations. Number of alleles and average heterozygosity were not significantly different between C. collina patches in small versus large outcrops. Vegetative reproduction enables small patches to persist for many years and apparently maintains genetic diversity despite low levels of seed production. Pollinators and insect herbivores of C. collina were not significantly less numerous on small outcrops than on large outcrops, suggesting that species interactions are not directly responsible for reproductive failure on small outcrops. The annual herb, Helianthus exilis, was entirely absent from small outcrops. This locally distributed serpentine endemic is restricted to moist seeps, a specialized microhabitat found only within large serpentine outcrops. Transplant experiments showed that H. exilis survives poorly or not at all outside these narrow conditions. Results from these investigations illustrate the need to protect serpentine landscapes that contain multiple local populations and the full range of microhabitats that are inhabited by serpentine endemic plants.

AB Null models are pattern-generating models that deliberately exclude a mechanism of interest, and allow for randomization tests of ecological and biogeographic data. Although they have had a controversial history, null models are widely used as statistical tools by ecologists and biogeographers. Three active research fronts in null model analysis include biodiversity measures, species co-occurrence patterns, and macroecology. In the analysis of biodiversity, ecologists have used random sampling procedures such as rarefaction to adjust for differences in abundance and sampling effort. In the analysis of species co-occurrence and assembly rules, null models have been used to detect the signature of species interactions. However, controversy persists over the details of computer algorithms used for randomizing presence-absence matrices. Finally, in the newly emerging discipline of macroecology, null models can be used to identify constraining boundaries in bivariate scatterplots of variables such as body size, range size, and population density. Null models provide specificity and flexibility in data analysis that is often not possible with conventional statistical tests.

AB 1. Stones along the shore of a eutrophic English lake in summer have one of two epilithic assemblages. Many stones are covered with dense filaments of the macro-alga Cladophora glomerata and the tubes of detritivorous/browsing chironomids, Others have few algal filaments and are dominated by gallery-building caddis larvae (Tinodes waeneri). These communities are patchily distributed along the shore, macro-algae dominating in areas away from riparian trees and on tall, rather than flat stones. The origins of this dichotomy were assessed in a field experiment that provided new surfaces for colonization, according to a planned schedule in time and space.
   2. To examine temporal heterogeneity, artificial substrata (clay tiles) were introduced into the littoral each month from February to October 1995 and harvested on several occasions from 1 to 9 months later. 'Large' scale spatial heterogeneity was investigated by introducing tiles into three locations along the shore that differed with respect to shoreline trees. At a smaller scale, tiles were introduced with varying degrees of accessibility to dispersing insect larvae by placing them directly on the lake bed, above the bed on platforms, or as stacks of several tiles (to mimic tall stones).
   3. There was a distinct temporal separation in the colonization of invertebrates, with tube-building chironomid larvae dominating substrata in spring, before being displaced by Tinodes in summer. A strong temporal pattern in algal productivity, with spring and autumn maxima and a summer minimum, was attributable to nutrient limitation in summer.
   4. In summer, there was a strong spatial separation of organisms at large and small scales. In patches under or near trees, chironomids and Cladophora were replaced by Tinodes larvae. Cladophora remained abundant away from trees, where tiles were never colonized by the crawling Tinodes larvae, originating from egg masses laid beneath trees. Areas distant from oviposition sites may act as a grazing refugium for Cladophora and its associated chironomids. At a smaller scale, the inability of Tinodes to colonize the upper surfaces of tall stones also created spatial refugia for algae and chironomids, even within patches of generally high Tinodes density.
   5. There was also evidence of a temporal grazing refugium for Cladophora. Cladophora filaments which colonized tiles introduced in April subsequently resisted grazing by Tinodes newly recruiting in June. Filaments colonizing tiles introduced before or after April, however, were vulnerable to Tinodes. The precise mechanism for this is unclear, however.
   6. Spatiotemporal patterns in the epilithic community were caused by the external factors of a seasonally fluctuating nutrient supply and a patchy riparian strip of trees and the intrinsic factors of habitat choice, and the life history phenology of the organisms concerned. Our results infer strong direct biotic interactions among species( particularly grazing of Cladophora by Tinodes), indirect interactions between Tinodes and several chironomids via habitat engineering (i.e. the removal of Cladophora as chironomid habitat) and the crucial role of spatiotemporal heterogeneity in decoupling those interactions.

AB A perennial challenge in ecology is to develop dynamical systems models that appropriately abstract and characterize the dynamics of natural systems. Deriving an appropriate model of system dynamics can be a long and iterative process whose outcome depends critically on the quality of empirical data describing the long-term behavior of a natural system. Most ecological time series are insufficient to offer insight into the way organizational hierarchies and spatial scales are causally linked to natural system dynamics. Moreover, the classic tradition of hypothesis testing in ecology is not likely to lead to those key insights. This because empirical research is geared almost exclusively toward testing model predictions based on underlying causal relationships assumed by theorists. So, empirical research relies heavily on theory for guidance on what is or is not dynamically relevant. I argue here that it is entirely possible to reduce much of this guesswork involved with deciding on causal structure by giving empirical research a new role in theory development. In this role, natural history and field observations are used to develop stochastic, individual-based and spatially explicit computational models or IBMs that can explore the range of contingency and complexity inherent in real-world systems.
   IBMs can be used to run simulations allowing deductions to be made about the causal linkages between organizational hierarchies, spatial scales, and dynamics. These deductions can be tested under field conditions using experiments that manipulate the putative causal structure and evaluate the dynamical consequences. The emerging insights from this stage can then be used to inspire an analytical construct that embodies the dynamically relevant scales and mechanisms. In essence, computational modeling serves as an intermediate step in theory development in that a wide range of possibly important biological details are considered and then reduced to a subset that is dynamically relevant.
