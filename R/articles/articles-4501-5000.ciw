AB P>1. Invasive species in aquatic systems are major drivers of changes in biodiversity. Amphipods are key species in freshwaters, with invasive amphipods either replacing or coexisting with native species and often damaging local biodiversity. However, the consequences of interactions among native and invasive amphipods for their habitat use and feeding ecology and ecosystem function are not yet well understood.
   2. We examined a number of streams in Brittany and Northern Ireland, with native and invasive amphipods, to evaluate the consequences of species interactions for both habitat use and diet. Our field studies centred on testing two proposed models: a cohabitation model without competition between two native species (Gammarus pulex vs Echinogammarus berilloni), and a competition model between an invasive and a native species (Gammarus pulex vs Gammarus duebeni celticus). For these three species, alone and in combination, we assessed their habitat use and feeding patterns, the latter through gut contents and stable C and N isotope analyses of their tissues.
   3. When existing as single-species populations, all three species used stream habitats broadly similarly, although G. pulex was more strongly associated with leaf litter and vegetation compared to pebble substrata than the other species. When G. pulex coexisted with either E. berilloni or G. d. celticus, the latter two changed to using all habitats equally, whereas the former retained its habitat preferences.
   4. Similarly, all three species when alone had similar gut contents, with inorganic material predominating, followed by leaf and woody material and more rarely algae and invertebrates. When G. pulex coexisted with E. berilloni, the diet of the latter did not change; however, the frequency of inorganic matter, leaves and wood declined in the gut contents of G. pulex. When G. pulex coexisted with G. d. celticus, the pattern of gut contents did not change in either species.
   5. When existing as single-species populations, G. pulex had a broader range of isotopic signatures, both for delta 13C and for delta 15N, than the two other species, indicating a more variable diet among individuals. When G. pulex coexisted with either E. berilloni or G. d. celticus, the latter two had similar ranges of delta 13C and delta 15N, whereas for G. pulex the range was much less for delta 13C and delta 15N, suggesting a less diverse diet.
   6. Our results infer two different modes of coexistence between native and non-native amphipods. We have shown that the native species, which coexist stably, appear to show interference competition, leading to spatial habitat segregation, whereas competition for food and possible intraguild predation by G. pulex on G. d. celticus would explain why the distribution and density of the latter is affected by G. pulex. However, since all the species have a similar diet and feeding habit, we expect no great overall effect on ecosystem processes as a consequence of species interactions and displacements.

AB Climate change is expected to negatively impact many freshwater environments due to reductions in stream-flow and increases in temperature. These conditions, however, can already be found today in areas experiencing significant drought; current observations of species' responses to droughts can be used to make predictions about their future responses to climate change. Using otolith analysis, we recreated golden perch (Macquaria ambigua) growth chronologies from two temperate lake populations in southeastern Australia over a 15-year period pre- and during a supraseasonal drought. We related interannual growth variation to landscape-scale changes in temperature and hydrological regimes: fish growth declined as water levels in the lakes dropped during the drought, but this effect was offset by increased growth in warmer years. We hypothesize that golden perch are responding to fluctuations in food availability and intraspecific competition related to water level and to an optimization of physiological growth conditions related to increases in growing season length. Based on our analyses, we made predictions of future growth under a number of climate change scenarios that incorporate forecast deviations in stream-flows and air temperature. Despite climatic models predicting significant declines in future water availability, fish growth may increase due to a disproportionate lengthening of the growing season. As the two lakes are at the limit of the southerly range of golden perch, our results are consistent with previous findings of climate-change driven latitudinal range shifts in a poleward direction. We discuss assumptions concerning the constancy of ecological interactions into the future that warrant further study. Our research provides a novel application of biochronological analysis that could be used elsewhere to further our knowledge of species responses to changing environments.

AB The advent of rapid complete genome sequencing, and the potential to capture this information in genome-scale metabolic models, provide the possibility of comprehensively modeling microbial community interactions. For example, Rhodoferax and Geobacter species are acetate-oxidizing Fe(III)-reducers that compete in anoxic subsurface environments and this competition may have an influence on the in situ bioremediation of uranium-contaminated groundwater. Therefore, genome-scale models of Geobacter sulfurreducens and Rhodoferax ferrireducens were used to evaluate how Geobacter and Rhodoferax species might compete under diverse conditions found in a uranium-contaminated aquifer in Rifle, CO. The model predicted that at the low rates of acetate flux expected under natural conditions at the site, Rhodoferax will outcompete Geobacter as long as sufficient ammonium is available. The model also predicted that when high concentrations of acetate are added during in situ bioremediation, Geobacter species would predominate, consistent with field-scale observations. This can be attributed to the higher expected growth yields of Rhodoferax and the ability of Geobacter to fix nitrogen. The modeling predicted relative proportions of Geobacter and Rhodoferax in geochemically distinct zones of the Rifle site that were comparable to those that were previously documented with molecular techniques. The model also predicted that under nitrogen fixation, higher carbon and electron fluxes would be diverted toward respiration rather than biomass formation in Geobacter, providing a potential explanation for enhanced in situ U(VI) reduction in low-ammonium zones. These results show that genome-scale modeling can be a useful tool for predicting microbial interactions in subsurface environments and shows promise for designing bioremediation strategies.

AB Aim
   To study the effects of isolation and size of small tropical islands on species assemblages of bees (superfamily Apoidea) and wasps (superfamily Vespoidea).
   Location
   Twenty islands in the Kepulauan Seribu Archipelago off the coast of west Java, Indonesia. The size of surveyed islands ranges between 0.75 and 41.32 ha; their distance from the coast of Java varies between 3 and 62 km.
   Methods
   Field work was conducted from February to May 2005. Bees and wasps were caught with a sweep net during sampling units of 15 min, continuing until four consecutive samples revealed no new species. Total species richness was quantified by the estimators Chao 2, first-order jackknife and Michaelis-Menten. The software binmatnest was used to test for nestedness of species assemblages. Similarities of species composition between islands were quantified by S circle divide rensen's similarity index.
   Results
   Eighty-two species were recorded on the 20 surveyed islands. Species richness declined with increasing isolation of islands from the source area, Java. Although the size of the largest island exceeded that of the smallest island by a factor of almost 60, island size only very weakly affected species richness of bees; no effect of island size was found for wasps. Mean body size of species decreased with increasing island isolation. Nestedness of island faunas was only weakly developed. Species composition of both superfamilies was affected by island isolation, but not by island size.
   Main conclusions
   While the species-isolation relationship on the very small islands of Kepulauan Seribu followed the prediction of MacArthur and Wilson's equilibrium theory, the absence of a species-area relationship indicated a weak 'small-island effect', at least in wasps. The combination of an only weakly developed pattern of nested species subsets, the shift in species compositions and the decline of mean body size with increasing island isolation from the source area indicates that biotic interactions and different species traits contribute to the shaping of communities of bees and wasps within the archipelago. The potential of biotic interactions for generating distribution patterns of species within the archipelago is also emphasized by the observed restriction of some species with apparently high dispersal abilities to outer islands.

AB Aim
   During recent and future climate change, shifts in large-scale species ranges are expected due to the hypothesized major role of climatic factors in regulating species distributions. The stress-gradient hypothesis suggests that biotic interactions may act as major constraints on species distributions under more favourable growing conditions, while climatic constraints may dominate under unfavourable conditions. We tested this hypothesis for one focal tree species having three major competitors using broad-scale environmental data. We evaluated the variation of species co-occurrence patterns in climate space and estimated the influence of these patterns on the distribution of the focal species for current and projected future climates.
   Location
   Europe.
   Methods
   We used ICP Forest Level 1 data as well as climatic, topographic and edaphic variables. First, correlations between the relative abundance of European beech (Fagus sylvatica) and three major competitor species (Picea abies, Pinus sylvestris and Quercus robur) were analysed in environmental space, and then projected to geographic space. Second, a sensitivity analysis was performed using generalized additive models (GAM) to evaluate where and how much the predicted F. sylvatica distribution varied under current and future climates if potential competitor species were included or excluded. We evaluated if these areas coincide with current species co-occurrence patterns.
   Results
   Correlation analyses supported the stress-gradient hypothesis: towards favourable growing conditions of F. sylvatica, its abundance was strongly linked to the abundance of its competitors, while this link weakened towards unfavourable growing conditions, with stronger correlations in the south and at low elevations than in the north and at high elevations. The sensitivity analysis showed a potential spatial segregation of species with changing climate and a pronounced shift of zones where co-occurrence patterns may play a major role.
   Main conclusions
   Our results demonstrate the importance of species co-occurrence patterns for calibrating improved species distribution models for use in projections of climate effects. The correlation approach is able to localize European areas where inclusion of biotic predictors is effective. The climate-induced spatial segregation of the major tree species could have ecological and economic consequences.

AB Genetic variation in plants is known to influence arthropod assemblages and species interactions. However, these influences may be contingent upon local environmental conditions. Here, we examine how plant genotype-based trophic interactions and patterns of natural selection change across environments. Studying the cottonwood tree, Populus angustifolia, the galling aphid, Pemphigus betae and its avian predators, we used three common gardens across an environmental gradient to examine the effects of plant genotype on gall abundance, gall size, aphid fecundity and predation rate on galls. Three patterns emerged: (i) plant genotype explained variation in gall abundance and predation, (ii) GxE explained variation in aphid fecundity, and environment explained variation in gall abundance and gall size, (iii) natural selection on gall size changed from directional to stabilizing across environments.

AB Questions: To what degree do biological soil crusts (BSCs), which are regulators of the soil surface boundary, influence associated microbial communities? Are these associations important to ecosystem functioning in a Mediterranean semi-arid environment?
   Location: Gypsum outcrops near Belmonte del Tajo, Central Spain.
   Methods: We sampled a total of 45 (50 cm x 50 cm) plots, where we estimated the cover of every lichen and BSC-forming lichen species. We also collected soil samples to estimate bacterial species richness and abundance, and to assess different surrogates of ecosystem functioning. We used path analysis to evaluate the relationships between the richness/abundance of above-and below-ground species and ecosystem functioning.
   Results: We found that the greatest direct effect upon the ecosystem function matrix was that of the biological soil crust (BSC) richness matrix. A few bacterial species were sensitive to the lichen community, with a disproportionate effect of Collema crispum and Toninia sedifolia compared to their low abundance and frequency. The lichens Fulgensia subbracteata and Toninia spp. also had negative effects on bacteria, while Diploschistes diacapsis consistently affected sensitive bacteria, sometimes positively. Despite these results, very few of the BSC effects on ecosystem function could be ascribed to changes within the bacterial community.
   Conclusion: Our results suggest the primary importance of the richness of BSC-forming lichens as drivers of small-scale changes in ecosystem functioning. This study provides valuable insights on semi-arid ecosystems where plant cover is spatially discontinuous and ecosystem function in plant interspaces is regulated largely by BSCs.

AB Invasive species can benefit from altered species interactions in their new range, and by interfering with species interactions among native competitors. Since exotic invasions are generally studied at the species level, relatively little is known about intraspecific variation in the traits that determine an invader's effect on native species. Alliaria petiolata is a widespread and aggressive invader of forest understories that succeeds in part by interfering with mutualistic interactions between native plants and soil fungi. Here, I show that the impact of A. petiolata on soil microbial communities varied among individuals due to variation in their allelochemical concentrations. The differential impacts translated into varied effects on native tree growth, partly because A. petiolata's allelochemicals preferentially affected the most mutualistic fungal taxa. These results highlight the importance of considering the spatial and temporal variation in an invasive species' impacts for understanding and managing the invasion process.

AB The occurrence and spatio-temporal distribution of the larvae of exotic Blenniidae Omobranchus punctatus (Valenciennes, 1836) was studied at Babitonga Bay, a subtropical estuary of Southern Brazilian Coast. Samples were collected in 26 ichthyoplankton surveys (28 stations) from April 2004 to August 2008. Oblique hauls were used, with both a conical plankton net fitted with 200 mu m mesh and by a cylindrical-conical plankton net fitted with 500 mu m mesh (two and five minutes hauls, respectively). Larvae occurred continuously throughout the sampling and an increase in density was observed in the period from November to April. Specimens were registered throughout the study area. The occurrence of a wide range of ontogenetic stages indicates that the species is maintaining the population within Babitonga Bay. The lack of information about the potential impacts of O. punctatus in the ichthyoplankton assembly, with regard to ecological interactions and the food chain suggests the need for further studies.

AB As herbivory usually leads to loss of photosynthesizing biomass, its consequences for plants are often negative. However, in favorable conditions, effects of herbivory on plants may be neutral or even beneficial. According to the compensatory continuum hypothesis plants can tolerate herbivory best in resource-rich conditions. Besides herbivory, also primarily positive biotic interactions like mycorrhizal symbiosis, bear carbon costs. Tritrophic plant-fungus-herbivore interaction further complicates plant's cost-benefit balance, because herbivory of the host plant is expected to cause decline in mycorrhizal colonization under high availability of soil nutrients when benefits of symbiosis decline in relation to costs. To gain insight into above interactions we tested the effects of plant size and resource manipulation (simulated herbivory and fertilization) on both above-ground performance and on root fungal colonization of the biennial Gentianella campestris.
   Clipping caused allocation shift from height growth to branches in all groups except in large and fertilized plants. For large plants nutrient addition may have come too late, as the number of meristems was most likely determined already before the fertilization. Clipping decreased the amount of DSE (dark septate endophytic) fungi which generally are not considered to be mycorrhizal. The effect of clipping on total fungal colonization and colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal coils were found to depend on host size and resource level. Dissimilar mycorrhizal response to simulated herbivory in small vs. large plants could be due to more intensive light competition in case of small plants. Carbon limited small plants may not be able to maintain high mycorrhizal colonization, whereas large clipped plants allocate extra resources to roots and mycorrhizal fungi at the expense of above-ground parts. Our results suggest that herbivory may increase carbon limitation that leads re-growing shoots and fungal symbionts to function as competing sinks for the limited carbon reserves.

AB The recent range contractions and population declines of many grouse species worldwide have been attributed to loss and fragmentation of their habitats, although the empirical evidence for the actual drivers is often weak. In case of the willow ptarmigan Lagopus lagopus in Fennoscandia, ungulate overbrowsing of willows has been hypothesized to exert such negative habitat-related impacts. Moreover, a steep population decline of willow ptarmigan in southern Fennoscandia has recently been attributed to community interactions linking the fate of the willow ptarmigan to a change in keystone tundra rodent populations. Community and habitat factors may also interact in their impact on willow ptarmigan abundance. Here we assess whether willow thicket structural characteristics sensitive to ungulate browsing impacted willow ptarmigan habitat occupancy and whether such impacts depended on small rodent population dynamics. We employed an extensive survey approach spatially encompassing three riparian tundra regions and covering the phases of increase, peak and crash of the small rodent cycle. Willow ptarmigan habitat occupancy increased with the areal extent of willow thickets, whereas it decreased with increasing degree of thicket fragmentation (i.e. habitat shredding). Both of these effects were consistent with ungulate over-browsing impacting willow ptarmigan abundance negatively. Over the 4-year study period, willow ptarmigan habitat occupancy declined steeply independently of spatial variation in willow thicket areal extent and fragmentation. Moreover, the expected increase in ptarmigan populations during the increase/peak phase of the rodent cycle was not observed. Thus although our study provides support for the hypothesis that intense ungulate browsing negatively impacts willow ptarmigan, our study also suggests that causes of the current steep decline of ptarmigan populations in northern Fennoscandia should be sought in factors other than habitat fragmentation and changed rodent population dynamics.

AB Urban ecosystems pose different environmental constraints on plant and animal communities than natural ecosystems, and this in turn might affect ecological interactions. We investigated plant pollinator interactions in urban vegetation communities in the context of local community structure and two landscape metrics describing the surrounding urban matrix. We recorded plant species diversity, floral density, pollinator species and floral visits at 89 flowering patches within the urban matrix, and used Trifolium pratense as a focal plant species.
   We correlated visits by all species, by bees, by bees when excluding the main visitor Bombus pascuorum, and by the main visitor alone T. pratense with the landscape metrics "green area", representing the total extent of vegetated areas, and "edge density of green areas", representing the degree of habitat fragmentation, at scales from 20 to 200 m. Extent of green area was positively correlated with visits by all species, by bees, and by Bombus pascuorum, but negatively with bees excluding the main visitor. The correlation increased with scale for all four variables, and the strongest correlations were found for B. pascuorum. The direction of correlation between edge density and the visitation variables was similar as for green area, but showed considerable variation at scales below 100 m radius.
   Visits by all bees and all visitors to T. pratense were negatively affected by flowering plant species diversity. There was a positive interaction between extent of green area and plant diversity on bee visitation, and a negative interaction between the extent of green area and heterospecific flowers for bees (excluding B. pascuorum). Increasing floral abundance and plant diversity reduced pollinator visitation to T. pro tense, suggesting competitive effects through both quantity and diversity of resources. Competition for flower visitors was mainly from Lotus corniculatus and Trifolium repens, both of which frequently co-occurred with T. pratense.
   We conclude that T. pratense competes for pollinators with other co-occurring plants, but that the nature of the surrounding urban matrix mediates interactions among plant species for pollinator services at different scales, particularly with respect to the proportion of green areas.

AB P>1. Most studies of tree regeneration are limited to particular environments and may not capture variation in the biotic or abiotic factors that regulate recruitment at larger spatial scales. Critical processes such as competition and facilitation can vary spatially, along gradients in resource availability and environmental stress, and temporally, with plant development.
   2. We examined patterns of natural tree recruitment and experimentally followed germination and seedling survival of five tree species (pioneer to late seral) in three early successional communities of contrasting bio-physical environments in a rural landscape on Chiloe Island, Chile.
   3. We quantified natural recruitment of juveniles and saplings and assessed relationships between tree density and local environment. We used a removal experiment to test the influence of early successional vegetation on seed germination and early survival of tree species. In each community, seeds and seedlings were placed in paired experimental plots from which vegetation was removed or left intact (control). To identify potential correlates of germination and seedling survival, we measured light transmittance and soil properties in each plot.
   4. In all communities, established vegetation had either a positive or neutral effect on germination and/or survival although responses varied among life stages and species. Germination and survival were correlated with the lower levels of light in controls, consistent with negative correlations between natural tree densities and light. Vegetation cover was not dense enough to facilitate survival of late successional species, but not too dense to inhibit survival of shade-intolerant or mid-tolerant species. Among communities, natural densities of juveniles were greatest under conditions where experimental germination rates were highest. Seedling height growth was lowest in the community characterized by waterlogged soils, consistent with the naturally low transition rate from juveniles to saplings and a negative correlation between density of shade-intolerant trees and soil moisture.
   5.Synthesis. Our experiments indicate strong, mostly positive controls (facilitation) on tree recruitment in early seral shrublands with differing bio-physical environments. Benefits of shading are manifested at different stages in the life history. However, community context is critical: variation in seasonal patterns of soil moisture may explain spatial variation in the density and size structure of natural tree recruitment.

AB In much of the northwest Atlantic Ocean, commercially important snow crab Chionoecetes opilio stocks have increased in abundance since the decline and collapse of major groundfish stocks such as Atlantic cod Gadus morhua. We examined 3 hypotheses to explain variation in the abundance of snow crabs across 10 regions: (1) climate control of both species, (2) top-down control of snow crab by cod and (3) bottom-up control of cod by snow crab. We tested these hypotheses by analyzing time series data of cod and crab abundance indices and temperature via meta-analysis of full and partial correlation coefficients. We found that temperature had an opposing effect on the 2 species: snow crab abundance was negatively correlated with temperature at 7 to 10 yr lags, whereas cod and temperature were positively related at 1 to 7 yr lags. Controlling for the effect of temperature, our meta-analysis revealed significant negative correlations of snow crab and cod abundance, with cod leading snow crab by up to a 5 yr lag. This suggests a top-down effect on older juvenile and subadult snow crab. We found no evidence of a bottom-up effect of snow crab on cod. Negative correlations between cod and crab abundance were observed both at the warmer and colder portions of their ranges. These results suggest that snow crab abundance is largely influenced by temperature during the early postsettlement years and becomes increasingly regulated by top-down mechanisms during the years approaching fishery recruitment. The method presented in this paper is generally useful to test ecological hypotheses from time series data, particularly where multiple causal mechanisms are suspected.

TI VERTEBRATE SPECIES RICHNESS VARIES WITH SPECIES ASSEMBLAGE IN
   SOUTH-EASTERN SPAIN: IMPLICATIONS FOR CONSERVATION

AB Species richness in an area is the result of environmental factors (e.g. primary productivity or habitat heterogeneity), historical factors (colonization, extinction, and human influences), and species interactions within the species assemblage. However, the relative importance of species assemblage, in respect to other factors, on species richness has rarely been analysed. This study analyses the relative importance of environment and species assemblage on vertebrate species richness in south-eastern Spain. The results show that 37 % of the variance in species richness was explained by the correlation between species assemblage and environmental-spatial variables. Species richness increased with habitat heterogeneity (habitat diversity and altitude range), but this effect was independent of species assemblage. Species richness differed among species assemblages in the study area, independently of the effect of environmental and spatial variables. Therefore, the findings suggest that species richness is also influenced by species composition per se, regardless of the influence of other variables. These findings imply that the use of species richness in indices for prioritizing conservation zones may bias conservation priorities towards species assemblages having more species richness. This problem, however, is solved when complementarity algorithms are used to prioritize conservation zones.

AB Rainfall seasonality can strongly influence biotic interactions by affecting host plant quality, and thus potentially regulating herbivore exposure to natural enemies. Plant defences are predicted to increase from dry to wet forests, rendering wet-forest caterpillars more vulnerable to parasitoids due to the slow-growth-high-mortality hypothesis. We collected and reared caterpillars from the understorey and trail edges of a wet forest and a seasonally dry forest to determine whether wet-forest caterpillars suffered a higher prevalence of parasitism and were less abundant than dry-forest caterpillars. In the two forests, caterpillar abundances (on average 8 h(-1)) and prevalence of parasitism (18%) were very similar regardless of feeding niche for both parasitism (27% versus 29% in shelter builders, and 16% versus 11% in external feeders) and caterpillar abundances (shelter builders: 1.42 versus 2.39, and external feeders: 8.27 versus 5.49 caterpillars h(-1)) in the dry and wet forests, respectively. A similar comparative analysis conducted in the canopy and understorey of the dry forest revealed a higher prevalence of parasitism in the canopy (43%) despite caterpillar densities similar to those in the understorey. Overall, shelter builders suffered higher parasitism than external feeders (32% versus 14.9%), and were attacked primarily by flies, whereas external feeders were more vulnerable to attack by parasitoid wasps.

AB In the lowlands of central Panama, the Neotropical pioneer tree Trema micrantha (sensu lato) exists as two cryptic species: "landslide'' Trema is restricted to landslides and road embankments, while "gap'' Trema occurs mostly in treefall gaps. In this study, we explored the relative contributions of biotic interactions and physical factors to habitat segregation in T. micrantha. Field surveys showed that soils from landslides were significantly richer in available phosphorus and harbored distinct arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) communities compared to gap soils. Greenhouse experiments designed to determine the effect of these abiotic and biotic differences showed that: (1) both landslide and gap species performed better in sterilized soil from their own habitat, (2) the availability of phosphorus and nitrogen was limiting in gap and landslide soils, respectively, (3) a standardized AMF inoculum increased performance of both species, but primarily on gap soils, and (4) landslide and gap species performed better when sterilized soils were inoculated with the microbial inoculum from their own habitat. A field experiment confirmed that survival and growth of each species was highest in its corresponding habitat. This experiment also showed that browsing damage significantly decreased survival of gap Trema on landslides. We conclude that belowground interactions with soil microbes and aboveground interactions with herbivores contribute in fundamental ways to processes that may promote and reinforce adaptive speciation.

AB While communities are shaped by both local interactions and enrichment from the regional species pool, we propose a hypothesis that the balance of these forces shifts with latitude, with regional enrichment dominating at high latitudes and local interactions dominating at low latitudes. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a latitudinal-scale experiment with marine epifaunal communities. In four regions of the North Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea, we used mimics of ecosystem engineers to manipulate biogenic structural complexity. We iteratively evaluated diversity patterns of experimental communities up to one year after deployment. Additional data were also collected from one of our tropical sites 2.5 years after initial deployment. As hypothesized, we found a reciprocal latitudinal gradient in the effects of the structurally complex mimics and regional enrichment. In the tropics, local diversity was always higher in association with the mimics than in exposed areas that were more open to predation. This effect was consistent across two spatial scales and beyond the one-year timescale of the experiment. In temperate communities, no consistent effects of the mimics on diversity were observed. However, the proportion of species from the regional species pool that were present at the local scale increased from the tropics to the temperate zone, consistent with the hypothesis that higher-latitude communities may experience greater influence from the regional species pool than communities at low latitudes. This study represents the first large-scale experimental demonstration that suggests that the relative impact of local interactions and regional enrichment on community diversity may depend on latitude.

AB P>Resolving how complexity affects stability of natural communities is of key importance for predicting the consequences of biodiversity loss. Central to previous stability analysis has been the assumption that the resources of a consumer are substitutable. However, during their development, most species change diets; for instance, adults often use different resources than larvae or juveniles. Here, we show that such ontogenetic niche shifts are common in real ecological networks and that consideration of these shifts can alter which species are predicted to be at risk of extinction. Furthermore, niche shifts reduce and can even reverse the otherwise stabilizing effect of complexity. This pattern arises because species with several specialized life stages appear to be generalists at the species level but act as sequential specialists that are hypersensitive to resource loss. These results suggest that natural communities are more vulnerable to biodiversity loss than indicated by previous analyses.

AB Land use changes can dramatically impact bird populations: directly through habitat loss, but also indirectly through altered species interactions. In this study, we used 240 artificial ground and bush nests baited with chicken (Gallus gallus) eggs for eight days to assess levels of nest predation in an anthropogenic habitat mosaic in the Korup region, western Central Africa. Artificial nests were equally distributed among 24 plots within four distinct habitat types: (1) near-primary forest, (2) secondary forest, (3) agroforestry systems, and (4) annual crops. Similar to other artificial nest predation studies, we found a significantly higher predation rate of ground nests compared to bush nests: nearly one third (34/120, or 28%) of ground nests were plundered, whereas only 12% (14/120) of bush nests experienced predation. There was no effect of habitat type on predation rates of ground nor bush nests and we did not find relationships between vegetation parameters (bush cover and height) and predation rate. From observations of nest remains and animal footprints around depredated nests we roughly categorised animal predators into small- (mammal and reptile) and medium-sized (mammal and monitor lizard) predators. The proportion of cases of predation by medium-sized predators were larger than expected in secondary forest but lower in agroforestry systems and annual crops, while the opposite was the case for small-sized predators. Nest loss from direct human disturbance was recorded especially in agroforestry systems. Overall, human activities such as hunting and snaring of medium-sized mammalian predators as well as landscape context (forest matrix) may have been the primary determinants of the results of this study.

AB The objectives of this work were to examine the past, current and potential influence of global climate change on the spatial distribution of some commercially exploited fish and to evaluate a recently proposed new ecological niche model (ENM) called nonparametric probabilistic ecological niche model (NPPEN). This new technique is based on a modified version of the test called Multiple Response Permutation Procedure (MRPP) using the generalized Mahalanobis distance. The technique was applied in the extratropical regions of the North Atlantic Ocean on eight commercially exploited fish species using three environmental parameters (sea surface temperature, bathymetry and sea surface salinity). The numerical procedure and the model allowed a better characterization of the niche (sensu Hutchinson) and an improved modelling of the spatial distribution of the species. Furthermore, the technique appeared to be robust to incomplete or bimodal training sets. Despite some potential limitations related to the choice of the climatic scenarios (A2 and B2), the type of physical model (ECHAM 4) and the absence of consideration of biotic interactions, modelled changes in species distribution explained some current observed shifts in dominance that occurred in the North Atlantic sector, and particularly in the North Sea. Although projected changes suggest a poleward movement of species, our results indicate that some species may not be able to track their climatic envelope and that climate change may have a prominent influence on fish distribution during this century. The phenomenon is likely to trigger locally major changes in the dominance of species with likely implications for socio-economical systems. In this way, ENMs might provide a new management tool against which changes in the resource might be better anticipated.

AB Climate change would have profound influences on community structure and composition, and subsequently has impacts on ecosystem functioning and feedback to climate change. A field experiment with increased temperature and precipitation was conducted to examine effects of experimental warming, increased precipitation and their interactions on community structure and composition in a temperate steppe in northern China since April 2005. Increased precipitation significantly stimulated species richness and coverage of plant community. In contrast, experimental warming markedly reduced species richness of grasses and community coverage. Species richness was positively dependent upon soil moisture (SM) across all treatments and years. Redundancy analysis (RDA) illustrated that SM dominated the response of community composition to climate change at the individual level, suggesting indirect effects of climate change on plant community composition via altering water availability. In addition, species interaction also mediated the responses of functional group coverage to increased precipitation and temperature. Our observations revealed that both abiotic (soil water availability) and biotic (interspecific interactions) factors play important roles in regulating plant community structure and composition in response to climate change in the semiarid steppe. Therefore these factors should be incorporated in model predicting terrestrial vegetation dynamics under climate change.

AB Aim
   An important issue regarding biodiversity concerns its influence on ecosystem functioning. Experimental work has led to the proposal of mechanisms such as niche complementarity. However, few attempts have been made to confirm these in natural systems, especially in forests. Furthermore, one of the most interesting unresolved questions is whether the effects of complementarity on ecosystem functioning (EF) decrease in favour of competitive exclusions over an increasing productivity gradient. Using records from permanent forest plots, we asked the following questions. (1) Is tree productivity positively related to diversity? (2) Does the effect of diversity increase in less productive forests? (3) What metric of diversity (e.g. functional or phylogenetic diversity) better relates to tree productivity?
   Location
   Temperate, mixed and boreal forests of eastern Canada.
   Methods
   Over 12,000 permanent forest plots, from temperate to boreal forests, were used to test our hypotheses in two steps. (1) Stepwise regressions were used to identify the best explanatory variables for tree productivity. (2) The selected climatic and environmental variables, as well as density and biodiversity indices, were included in a structural equation model where links (paths) between covarying variables are made explicit, making structural equation modelling the best tool to explore such complicated causal networks.
   Results
   This is the first large-scale demonstration of a strong, positive and significant effect of biodiversity on tree productivity with control for climatic and environmental conditions. Important differences were noted between the two forest biomes investigated.
   Main conclusions
   We show for the first time that complementarity may be less important in temperate forests growing in a more stable and productive environment where competitive exclusion is the most probable outcome of species interactions, whereas in the more stressful environment of boreal forests, beneficial interactions between species may be more important. The present work is also a framework for the analysis of large datasets in biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (B-EF) research.

AB P>1. Behavioural, morphological and coloration plasticity are common responses of prey to predation risk. Theory predicts that prey should respond to the relative magnitude of risk, rather than a single level of response to any risk level. In addition to conspecific and predator densities, prey growth and differentiation rates affect the duration of vulnerability to size- and stage-limited predators and therefore the relative value of defences.
   2. We reared tadpoles of the Neotropical treefrog Dendropsophus ebraccatus with or without cues from a predator (Belostoma sp.) in ecologically relevant warm or cool temperatures. To track phenotypic changes, we measured morphology, tail coloration and developmental stage at three points during the larval period.
   3. Cues from predators interacted with growth conditions causing tadpoles to alter their phenotype, changing only tail colour in response to predators in warm water, but both morphology and colour in cool growth conditions. Tadpoles with predators in warm water altered coloration early but converged on the morphology of predator-free controls. Water temperature alone had no effect on tadpole phenotype.
   4. We demonstrate that seemingly small variation in abiotic environmental conditions can alter the expression of phenotypic plasticity, consistent with predictions about how growth rate affects risk. Predator-induced tadpole phenotypes depended on temperature, with strong expression only in temperatures that slow development. Thermal modulation of plastic responses to predators may be broadly relevant to poikilotherm development. It is important to include a range of realistic growth conditions in experiments to more fully understand the ecological and evolutionary significance of plasticity.

AB P>1. In the prevailing context of concerns over climate change and its potential impacts on ecosystems, evaluating ecological consequences of climatic forcing has become a critical issue.
   2. Historical data on the abundance of organisms have been extensively used to characterize the ecological effects of climatic forcing through specific weather and/or climatic variables, with most of the studies confined to single population models.
   3. However, population responses to environmental fluctuations typically depend upon positive and negative feedbacks induced by interactions with other species. It is therefore important to integrate the insights gained from single population approaches into a multispecies perspective.
   4. Here we combine the hierarchical Bayesian modelling approach with the state-space formulation to extend the scope of previously proposed models of population dynamics under climatic forcing to multi-species systems.
   5. We use our model to analyse long-term macro-moth (Lepidoptera) community data from the Rothamsted Insect Survey network in the UK, using winter rainfall and winter temperature as environmental covariates.
   6. The effects of the two weather variables were consistent across species, being negative for winter rainfall and positive for winter temperature. The two weather variables jointly explained 15-40% of the total environmental variation affecting the dynamics of individual species, and could explain up to 90% of covariances in species dynamics.
   7. The contribution of interspecific interactions to community-level variation was found to be weak compared to the contributions of environmental forcing and intraspecific interactions.

AB P>1. Fundamental and realized spatial niches were investigated through a combination of laboratory and mesocosm experiments, field observations and null model analysis in three intertidal gobiid species (Bathygobius fuscus, Chaenogobius annularis and C. gulosus). Null models based on the results of single-species experiments were used to assess interspecific spatial use and coexistence on two different scales: (i) microhabitats within a tidepool ('microhabitat' scale); and (ii) distribution among a set of tidepools ('habitat-wide' scale).
   2. Patterns of microhabitat use varied from single to paired treatments, depending on paired species. Realized overlap of microhabitat use was smaller than would be expected from single-individual situations for intraspecific combinations, but not for interspecific ones.
   3. Patterns of tidepool occupancy (a measure of spatial niche breadth) in the mesocosm were influenced by interspecific interactions. Two Chaenogobius species, but not B. fuscus, decreased tidepool occupancy in the hetero-specific treatments compared with the mono-specific ones. For all interspecific combinations, spatial overlap (habitat-wide scale) was significantly lower than the values expected from mono-specific situations. The results also indicated a possible trade-off between competitiveness and growth efficiency in these fishes.
   4. Interspecific spatial overlap in the field was similar to that in the mesocosm experiment and the pattern of coexistence of gobiids can be explained by the results of our experiments.
   5. This study demonstrates that niches of intertidal fishes may experience modifications under the influence of species interactions and that null models based on controlled experiments can greatly facilitate the deciphering of such changes in niche structure.

AB P>1. Pathogens and immune challenges can induce changes in host phenotype in ways that indirectly impact important community interactions, including those that affect host-pathogen interactions.
   2. To explore host behavioural response to immune challenge, we exposed wild white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) to an immunogen from an endemic, zoonotic pathogen, the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi. White-footed mice are a major reservoir host of Lyme disease (LD) spirochetes in northeastern USA and an abundant member of forest communities. The activity patterns, foraging behaviour, and space use of white-footed mice have implications for population growth rates of community members upon which mice incidentally prey (i.e. gypsy moths and native thrushes), as well as potentially determining host-vector encounter rates and human risk of LD.
   3. Immunochallenge led to specific humoral (antibody) and cellular (i.e. elevated neutrophils and eosinophils) immune responses, supporting use of the immunogen as a surrogate for pathogenic infection.
   4. Immunochallenged mice had reduced wheel-running activity early in the night when measured in the lab. However, mouse activity, as measured by track plates in natural field experiments, did not differ between mice exposed to the immunogen and unexposed mice.
   5. Foraging behaviour of wild mice in the field - assessed with giving-up densities of seed at artificial feeding stations - was affected by exposure to the immunogen. Whereas immunochallenge did not influence whether foraging mice gained information on patch quality while foraging, it led to reductions in predator avoidance during foraging, suggesting that the proportion of space used by foraging mice may be greater as a result of immunochallenge. This increased space use is predicted to increase encounter rates with patchily distributed LD vectors (ticks) and with incidental prey items.
   6. Thus, immunochallenge in white-footed mice, and potentially pathogenic infection, have the potential to indirectly impact community interactions, including those important for pathogen transmission.

AB The effects of factors acting at small scale (grass/grass and grass/shrub biological interactions) and landscape scale (overgrazing and rainfall changes) on the development and permanence of banded vegetation patterns (VB) are assessed with a spatially explicit cellular automaton model. In particular, the influence of two environmental factors that are changing in many VB arid lands (rainfall and grazing pressures) is studied. Three rainfall regimes (representing 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 times the long-term rainfall average), five grazing intensities, two types (reversible and irreversible) of grazing disturbance, two grazing periodicities (chronic and pulse), two levels of grass colonization ability, positive and negative interactions between shrubs and grasses, and the efficiency of endozoochorous seed dispersal are simulated.
   The results show that the permanence of undisturbed VB depends on the interaction of two factors, rainfall regime and grass colonization ability. Type and intensity of grazing also modify VB cover and permanence; furthermore, long-term overgrazing may convert mixed grass/shrub plant communities to pure scrublands dominated by endozoochorous-dispersed shrubs due to competitive interactions between shrubs and grasses.
   Besides providing an adequate representation of the system's dynamics, the model is a useful tool that may be used to explore the consequences of climate change on management scenarios. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB P>1. Transplant experiments with adult plants showed that marsh plant zonation along estuarine salinity gradients develops according to species tolerances of abiotic factors and biotic interactions. Thus, glycophytes are restricted from salt marshes by abiotic stress, whereas halophytes are excluded from freshwater marshes by competition. We hypothesized that adult plant zonations along estuarine stress gradients are predefined by processes affecting plants during their seedling phase. In an experimental glasshouse study, we tested how a mixed community of glycophytes and halophytes developed during the first months of early establishment affected by different flooding and salinity regimes.
   2. We set up two factorial mesocosm experiments that tested the effects of three tidal regimes (daily tide, spring tide, no tide) and three salinity levels (fresh, brackish, salt) on the emergence and early establishment of glycophyte and halophyte seedlings. In the Emergence Experiment seedlings were identified and removed once per week. In the Establishment Experiment species cover was estimated every 2 weeks, and after 15 weeks final above-ground biomass of each species was determined.
   3. Both glycophytes and halophytes showed highest seedling emergence under freshwater conditions. Emergence of halophytes was less impaired by increased salinities than that of glycophytes. Emergence and establishment of glycophytes were extremely reduced under brackish and salt conditions, whereas under freshwater conditions, glycophytes showed a consistent increase in cover over time. Cover of halophytes showed a similar increase in brackish and salt treatments; however, in freshwater treatments it significantly decreased after week 9. While daily tides predominantly decreased seedling emergence and establishment, spring tides had no significant effects on seedlings in freshwater and negative effects in saltwater treatments.
   4. Synthesis. The ability of a species to germinate and emerge under conditions representing a particular position along an environmental gradient is necessary but not solely responsible for determining plant zonation patterns along estuarine marsh gradients. Our results show that competitive exclusion of halophytes by glycophytes as an important driver of marsh plant zonations along estuarine salinity gradients takes effect already during the early seedling establishment phase of the co-occurring plants.

AB P>1. The stress-gradient hypothesis predicts an increase in the importance and intensity of positive species interactions towards extreme ends of gradients generated by either physical stress or consumer pressure. However, little attention has been devoted to assessing how the co-occurrence of different gradients of stress and variations in the abundance of the benefactor can influence switches in species interactions.
   2. On shallow rocky reefs, we assessed shifts in the effects of different covers of Vermetid tube-building gastropods (benefactor) on macroalgae (beneficiary), under experimental conditions generated by crossing a gradient of consumer pressure (sea urchin density) and a gradient of physical stress (sediment deposition).
   3. Negative effects of Vermetids on macroalgae in the absence of herbivores switched to positive at intermediate grazing pressure, but sedimentation and benefactor cover determined their intensity. Thus, association with Vermetids provides macroalgae with a refuge from herbivores. When consumer pressure was the greatest, facilitation persisted both at natural and moderately enhanced sedimentation if the benefactor cover was reduced. When the benefactor monopolized space, facilitation was only observed at natural levels of sedimentation. Thus, the relationship between the outcome of the benefactor-beneficiary interaction (expressed as the Relative Interaction Index) and consumer pressure varied from linear to asymptotic or quadratic, according to sedimentation levels and benefactor abundance.
   4.Synthesis. These results show that shifts in the direction and intensity of species interactions are regulated by the interplay of biological and physical factors. In addition, they suggest that density-dependent processes are more likely to shape species interactions at extreme ends of gradients of stress.

AB Structural features of both habitat remnants and surrounding matrix can be important for explaining plant population dynamics and ecosystem functions in human-impacted landscapes. However, little is known about how the structural features of the adjacent matrix affect biotic interactions and whether such context effects are subject to temporal variations. Using the hawthorn Crataegus monogyna in northern Spain, we studied matrix effects on two sequential plant-animal interactions, frugivory by birds and postdispersal seed predation by rodents. Using Hierarchical Linear Models, we compared the magnitude of both interactions on trees located in two patch types that strongly differed in structural features of the adjacent matrix habitat: patches totally surrounded by a degraded, structurally contrasted pastures (unconnected patches), and trees growing in patches adjacent to a lowly degraded, structurally similar mature forests (connected patches). We compared outcomes for 2005 and 2006, which were years with strong differences in community-wide fruit and seed abundance. Frugivory rate did not differ between patch types in either year, likely related to high mobility of birds. Seed predation rates were higher in unconnected patches than in connected ones, but only in 2005. We conclude that strong interannual fluctuations in resource availability are not rare in temperate systems and that recruitment rates could be frequently reduced within unconnected patches, thus collapsing plant regeneration processes of hawthorn populations. Overall, our results suggest that generalizations about potential effects of the matrix on plant-animal interactions within remnant patches must consider: (1) species-specific habitat responses of the organisms, (2) suitability of neighbouring habitats in terms of food supply, and (3) temporal variations in plant-resource availability for interacting animals.

AB Most models predicting changes to species distributions under future climate scenarios ignore dispersal processes, despite their importance in determining community structure in both terrestrial and aquatic systems ('supply-side ecology'). In the marine environment, facilitation of long-distance dispersal of coastal organisms by macrophytic rafts may be severely modified by climate impacts on raft supply, quality, and persistence, and on transport processes. Increasing storminess in the coastal zone, higher water temperatures, and changes in water circulation represent some of the key mechanisms that will directly affect rafts, while increases in herbivore metabolism due to higher water temperatures are likely to indirectly reduce raft longevity through raft consumption. Accurate predictions of climate impacts on coastal biodiversity will be contingent on resolution of factors influencing rafting so that this and other dispersal mechanisms can be incorporated into species distribution models.

AB Boundary habitats are frequently hot spots for the production and flow of organic matter (OM) and exert strong effects on ecological processes in the habitats which they link. Salt marshes, which are boundary habitats occurring between the land and the sea, are important sources of OM for coastal habitats. Primary productivity and tides are among the main causes of OM production and export from salt marshes. By field sampling and experiments we found that the stem-boring moth Haimbachia sp. nov. substantially increases the production of detritus in salt marshes along the SW Atlantic coastline. The larvae of this moth enhance the natural mortality of Spartina alterniflora and S. densiflora by feeding inside the basal and middle portions of the stem tissue. The attacks of the moth larvae produce dead and debilitated stems that are more easily broken and transported by the tides than non-attacked stems. Because the moth-attack frequencies will vary geographically in response to variation in the physical environment, the amount of OM flow between habitats will also vary, resulting in a positive relationship between moth-attack frequencies and OM production on a regional scale. Our field and experimental results show that herbivory by this moth and tidal transport could be the main determinants of the production of Spartina macrodetritus in these marshes. A key finding based on this previously undescribed interaction is that biological interactions (i.e. the effects of herbivores) can change the permeability of boundary habitats by altering the OM flow between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.

AB Species distribution models (SDMs) were applied to predict the distribution of benthic species in the North Sea. An understanding of species distribution patterns is essential to gain insight into ecological processes in marine ecosystems and to guide ecosystem management strategies. Therefore, we compared 9 different SDM methods, including GLM, GBM, FDA, SVM, RF, MAXENT, BIOCLIM, GARP and MARS, by using 10 environmental variables to model the distribution of 20 marine benthic species. Most of the models showed good or very good performance in terms of predictive power and accuracy, with highest mean area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.845 and 0.840, obtained for the MAXENT and GBM models, respectively. The poorest performance was shown by the BIOCLIM model, which had a mean AUC of 0.708. Nevertheless, the mapped distribution patterns varied remarkably depending on the model used, with up to 32.5% differences in predictions between models. For species with a narrow distribution range, the models showed a better performance based on the AUC than for species with a broad distribution range, which can most likely be attributed to the restricted spatial scale and the model evaluation procedure. Of the environmental variables, bottom water temperature and depth had the greatest effect on the distribution of 14 benthic species, based on MAXENT results. We examine the potential utility of this strategy for predicting future distribution of benthic species in response to climate change.

AB Natural ecosystems can show regular spatial vegetation patterns, which develop from small-scale ecological interactions. Some studies suggest that grazers can play a major role in controlling vegetation distribution in ecosystems with regular vegetation patterns, but the distribution of grazers and the effects of grazing on vegetation in spatially patterned ecosystems remains poorly understood. Here, we study how macrofaunal grazers are distributed on a spatially patterned intertidal flat and how they interact with benthic microalgae. The study was carried out on an intertidal flat where each year a regular spatial pattern of diatom-covered hummocks and water-filled hollows develops. In 2 consecutive years, benthic algal biomass was 5-fold lower in the hollows compared with the hummocks, whereas benthic macrofauna was equally abundant on both hummocks and hollows. In the laboratory we evaluated the interactive effect of landscape morphology (hummocks and hollows) and food abundance. Experiments with 2 abundant grazers, Corophium volutator and Hydrobia ulvae showed that food availability was the main driver for the spatial distribution of benthic herbivores rather than landscape morphology. Laboratory experiments, where we analyzed the grazing effects of H. ulvae and C. volutator on benthic algal biomass, revealed that both species increased biomass-specific primary production. This could indicate that benthic grazers can stimulate algal growth, which may explain the high grazer abundances in nearly bare hollows. Increased production of benthic algae may be a key factor uncoupling herbivore density from benthic algal biomass on a spatially patterned intertidal flat.

AB Marine ecosystems and their associated populations are increasingly at risk from the cumulative impacts of many anthropogenic threats that increase the likelihood of species extinction and altered community dynamics. In response, marine reserves can be used to protect exploited species and conserve biodiversity. The increased abundance of predatory species in marine reserves may cause indirect effects along chains of multi-trophic interactions. These trophic cascades can arise through direct predation, density-mediated indirect interactions (DMIIs), or indirect behavioural effects, termed trait-mediated indirect interactions (TMIIs). The extent of algal cover and the abundance of 4 primary consumers were determined in Lough Hyne, which was designated Europe's first marine nature reserve in 1981. The primary consumers were the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus, the topshell Gibbula cineraria, the oyster Anomia ephippium, and the scallop Chlamys varia. The abundances of 3 starfish species (Marthasterias glacialis, Asterias rubens, and Asterina gibbosa) were also determined, as were 2 potential crustacean predators, Necora puber and Carcinus maenas. These data were compared with historical data from a 1962 (prey) and a 1963 (predator) survey to determine the nature of community interactions over adjacent trophic levels. The present study reveals a breakdown in population structure of the 4 surveyed prey species. Marine reserve designation has led to an increase in predatory crabs and M. glacialis, a subsequent decrease in primary consumers, especially the herbivore P. lividus, and an increase in macroalgal cover which is indicative of a trophic cascade. The study shows that establishing a Marine Reserve does not guarantee that conservation benefits will be distributed equally.

AB Species richness and abundance of macrofauna on sandy shores increase from micro tidal reflective to macrotidal dissipative beach conditions. However, no attempt has been made to deconstruct these patterns. Using information on the macrofauna from 63 microtidal sandy beach surveys in South America, we deconstructed the community to discriminate among taxonomic groups, supralittoral and intertidal forms, and groups with different feeding habits and development modes. We also separated the effects of development mode and beach zone (intertidal vs. supralittoral) at the species level and scaled body size to density estimates. Total species richness decreased towards reflective beaches, but this trend was less marked in crustaceans than in molluscs or polychaetes. Supralittoral air-breathing crustaceans increased in richness and abundance from dissipative to reflective conditions, a reverse trend to that seen in intertidal crustaceans. Development modes ( species with direct development and with planktonic larvae) showed the same response to beach type as the community as a whole. Filter feeders, scavengers and deposit feeders showed the same trend, but the latter were scarce or absent on reflective beaches. Zone was more important than either development or feeding modes in determining individual species responses to beach type. Body size decreased and density increased from reflective to dissipative beaches, suggesting that smaller forms are more sensitive to harsh conditions where density is lower, and hence there is less scope for biological interactions in reflective beaches. The deconstruction approach provided insights into the relationships between life cycle characteristics and richness and abundance patterns and the relative importance of environmental variables in beach ecology.

AB Predators and prey are occasionally observed to comingle in close proximity on coral reefs. Both lethal and non-lethal (i.e. behavioral) effects of predators on prey are well documented. However, observations of apparent predator-prey interactions between the piscivorous twinspot snapper Lutjanus bohar and the herbivorous surgeonfish Acanthurus triostegus suggest that the nature of their association may be context-dependent. The context-dependent nature of some species interactions is well-known, and in some cases a single species has been shown to act as both predator and facilitator to its prey. We present incidental in situ observations suggesting that, in the context of voraciously grazing schools of A. triostegus, this species pair may also engage in a facultative mutualistic relationship. Specifically, we propose that within this context, both species may indirectly derive a benefit through changes in the behavior and/or density of territorial damselfishes driven by both L. bohar and A. triostegus. We provide prescriptions for rigorously testing this hypothesis and suggest that re-evaluation of this, and possibly other, ostensibly exclusive predator-prey pairs in marine systems may reveal unexpected relationships. Given the relative lack of examples of such interactions involving the same predator acting as both facilitator and predator from marine versus terrestrial systems, coupled with this preliminary evidence, we propose that this topic is ripe for exploration.

AB We review the progress made in the emerging field of coastal seascape ecology, i.e. the application of landscape ecology concepts and techniques to the coastal marine environment. Since the early 1990s, the landscape ecology approach has been applied in several coastal subtidal and intertidal biogenic habitats across a range of spatial scales. Emerging evidence indicates that animals in these seascapes respond to the structure of patches and patch mosaics in different ways and at different spatial scales, yet we still know very little about the ecological significance of these relationships and the consequences of change in seascape patterning for ecosystem functioning and overall biodiversity. Ecological interactions that occur within patches and among different types of patches (or seascapes) are likely to be critically important in maintaining primary and secondary production, trophic transfer, biodiversity, coastal protection, and supporting a wealth of ecosystem goods and services. We review faunal responses to patch and seascape structure, including effects of fragmentation on 5 focal habitats: seagrass meadows, salt marshes, coral reefs, mangrove forests, and oyster reefs. Extrapolating and generalizing spatial relationships between ecological patterns and processes across scales remains a significant challenge, and we show that there are major gaps in our understanding of these relationships. Filling these gaps will be crucial for managing and responding to an inevitably changing coastal environment. We show that critical ecological thresholds exist in the structural patterning of biogenic ecosystems that, when exceeded, cause abrupt shifts in the distribution and abundance of organisms. A better understanding of faunal-seascape relationships, including the identifications of threshold effects, is urgently needed to support the development of more effective and holistic management actions in restoration, site prioritization, and forecasting the impacts of environmental change.

AB Mixed-species foraging groups are well known for a broad range of taxonomic groups. Explanations have focused around 2 primary mechanisms: anti-predator behaviour and maximising foraging efficiency. In the ocean, feeding assemblages can involve seabirds, fish, cetaceans, pinnipeds and combinations of these groups. Here we examine association patterns between North Atlantic minke whales and seabirds. Based on the unique feeding strategies of different seabird guilds, predictions were made on the relationship between seabirds and whales in joint feeding assemblages (who profits from whom). These predictions were tested by modelling the presence of a whale with seabird aggregations using logistic regressions, involving presence/absence of seabird guilds, group sizes and measures of diversity as explanatory variables. A strong positive relationship was found between the presence of a whale with a seabird aggregation and the presence and group size of auks, the only seabird group able to concentrate fish on their own. No other seabird guild was relevant in predicting the presence of a whale. This suggests that 'beater' or 'pirate' theory best explains the relationship, with minke whales taking advantage of prey concentrations generated by the feeding behaviour of auks, and other bird groups taking advantage of dead, stunned or scattered prey left by the whales.

AB The diverse natural products found within sponges mediate many of their ecological interactions, including predator feeding deterrence and defense against fouling. Pyrrole-imidazole compounds, often involved in such ecological interactions, are exclusively found in marine sponges, mainly from the genera Axinella and Agelas. Employing field and laboratory assays, we studied the chemical defense of 2 co-occurring Mediterranean sponges, Axinella polypoides and A. verrucosa, collected from the Gulf of Naples, Italy, against microbial fouling, as well as their feeding deterrence against the generalist shrimp Palaemon elegans. These assays revealed no activity in the extracts of A. polypoides, while the n-butanol part of the A. verrucosa extract showed activity in all assays at natural concentrations. This fraction of the extract contains the bromopyrrole hymenidin, and our assays revealed antibacterial and feeding deterrence activity for this pure compound. H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance quantification confirmed the presence of hymenidin and debromo-carteramine A, another previously isolated antibacterial compound, at ecologically relevant concentrations in the n-butanol part of the A. verrucosa extract. Our results indicate different antimicrobial and feeding deterrence defense strategies in the 2 examined sympatric sponge species, and multiple defensive roles of hymenidin in the defense of A. verrucosa, similar to those of other bromopyrroles isolated from taxonomically related Caribbean sponges.

TI A capture-recapture model for exploring multi-species synchrony in

AB 1. Although recent decades have seen much development of statistical methods to estimate demographical parameters such as reproduction, and survival and migration probabilities, the focus is usually the estimation of parameters for individual species. This is despite the fact that several species may live in close proximity, sometimes competing for the same resources. There is therefore a great need for new methods that enable a better integration of demographical data, e.g. the study of synchrony between sympatric species, which are subject to common environmental stochasticity and potentially similar biotic interactions.
   2. We propose a mark-recapture statistical model that uses random effect terms for studying synchrony in a demographical parameter at a multi-species level, adapting a framework initially developed to study multi-site synchrony to this novel situation. The model allows us to divide between-year variance in a demographical parameter into a 'synchronous' component, common to all species considered, and species-specific 'asynchronous' components, as well as to estimate the proportion of each component accounted for by environmental covariates.
   3. We demonstrate the method with data from three colonially breeding auk species that share resources during the breeding season at the Isle of May, Scotland. Mark-resight information has been collected since 1984 for Atlantic puffins Fratercula arctica, common guillemots Uria aalge and razorbills Alca torda marked as breeding adults. We explore the relationship between synchrony in the species' survival and two environmental covariates.
   4. Most of the between-year variation was synchronous to the three species, and the same environmental covariates acted simultaneously as synchronising and desynchronising agents of adult survival, possibly through different indirect causation paths.
   5. Synthesis and applications. The model proposed allows the investigation of multi-species synchrony and asynchrony in adult survival, as well as the role of environmental covariates in generating them. It provides insight into whether sympatric species respond similarly or differently to changes in their environment, and helps to disentangle the sources of these differences. The estimated indices of synchrony/asynchrony can facilitate the generation of further hypotheses about similarities/differences in these species' ecology, such as the potential overlap of wintering areas. The method is readily applicable to other species, ecosystems and demographical parameters.

AB Most multicellular terrestrial organisms experience climate at scales of millimetres to metres, yet most species-climate associations are analysed at resolutions of kilometres or more. Because individuals experience heterogeneous microclimates in the landscape, species sometimes survive where the average background climate appears unsuitable, and equally may be eliminated from sites within apparently suitable grid cells where microclimatic extremes are intolerable. Local vegetation structure and topography can be important determinants of fine-resolution microclimate, but a literature search revealed that the vast majority of bioclimate studies do not include fine-scale habitat information, let alone a representation of how habitat affects microclimate. In this paper, we show that habitat type (grassland, heathland, deciduous woodland) is a major modifier of the temperature extremes experienced by organisms. We recorded differences among these habitats of more than 5 degrees C in monthly temperature maxima and minima, and of 10 degrees C in thermal range, on a par with the level of warming expected for extreme future climate change scenarios. Comparable differences were found in relation to variation in local topography (slope and aspect). Hence, we argue that the microclimatic effects of habitat and topography must be included in studies if we are to obtain sufficiently detailed projections of the ecological impacts of climate change to develop detailed adaptation strategies for the conservation of biodiversity.

AB Biodiversity has been established as a potential determinant of function in many ecosystems; however, previous research has mostly focused on primary producers and effects at a single trophic level. A broader perspective that considers multiple components of food webs is necessary to understand natural systems. In particular, consumer diversity needs to be more thoroughly examined as trophic interactions and indirect effects can alter ecosystem properties. We test the potential for consumer diversity (fish richness and composition) to govern food web dynamics at two levels of environmental complexity (mesocosms and experimental ponds) and explore the consequences of removing individual species of fish on lower trophic levels. In mesocosms, both the richness and density of zooplankton were reduced when more fish species were present. No effects from the fish treatments were found on phytoplankton, but phosphorus levels increased with higher fish richness. Removing either generalist or specialist fish species increased the richness and density of zooplankton and the amount of phytoplankton, whereas all fish species had redundant effects on nutrients. In ponds, a dominant fish species (specialist shiner) determined the richness and density of zooplankton. In contrast, phytoplankton and nutrients were reduced by higher fish richness in the fall and spring. Overall, the specialist shiner had unique effects on the pond food web suggesting the key to understanding function is the presence of a dominant species and their biological interactions. Differences between mesocosms and ponds are likely due to increased heterogeneity of resources in the ponds allowing species to specialize on different prey. Our study links the biodiversity ecosystem function paradigm with food web concepts to improve predictions for conservation and management actions in response to changes in biodiversity.

AB Recent evidence indicates that our current soil C stores may be already changing from carbon sinks to sources, with reported increasing C losses in both gaseous (soil respiration) and aqueous (dissolved organic carbon, DOC forms) across large areas of the Northern Hemisphere. Current debates have mainly focused on climatic variables; however, accounting for the abiotic and biotic interactions is required to enable better quantifications of C dynamics. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the interactive effects of temperature, moisture and dominant mesofauna (enchytraeids) changes on C losses by incubating root-free sieved soil samples from a peatland soil during 13 weeks at two temperature (14 and 19 C) and two moisture (85 and 60% WHC) treatments under laboratory conditions. Our results showed that neither temperature nor moisture and invertebrates had a significant effect on respiration rates. In contrast, under favourable moisture conditions, the temperature induced changes in enchytraeid population numbers resulted in more DOC being released from these soils, possibly linked to the positive effects of animal activities on iron mobilisation and buffering the pH of the soil solution. Our results also confirmed that moisture contents of 60% WHC could severely affect their population numbers in these organic soils and hence, the functioning of these vulnerable ecosystems. Importantly, in agreement with previous studies, availability of easily accessible C sources seems to be a critical factor in the progressive declines of soil respiration and DOC production rates over time. Taken these findings together it is possible to conclude that the combined action of abiotic factors and their influence on soil fauna populations plays a key role in controlling SOM decomposition rates of these peatland soils.

AB Studies of facilitative interactions as drivers of plant richness along environmental gradients often assume the existence of an overarching stress gradient that equally affects the performance of all the species in a given community. However, co-existing species differ in their ecophysiological adaptations, and do not experience the same stress level under particular environmental conditions. Moreover, these studies assume a unimodal relationship between richness and biomass, which is not as general as previously thought. We ignored these assumptions to assess changes in plant-plant interactions and their effect on local species richness across environmental gradients in semi-arid areas of Spain and Australia. We aimed to understand the relative importance of direct (microhabitat amelioration) and indirect (changes in the competitive relationships among the understorey species: niche segregation, competitive exclusion or intransitivity) mechanisms that might underlie the effects of nurse plants on local species richness. By jointly studying these direct and indirect mechanisms using a unifying framework, we found that nurse plants (trees, shrubs and tussock grasses) increased local richness not only by expanding the niche of neighbouring species but also by increasing niche segregation among them, though the latter was not important in all cases. The outcome of the competition-facilitation continuum varied depending on the study area, likely because the different types of stress gradient considered. When driven by both rainfall and temperature, or rainfall alone, the community-wide importance of nurse plants remained constant (Spanish sites), or showed a unimodal relationship along the gradient (Australian sites). This study expands our understanding of the relative roles of plant-plant interactions and environmental conditions as drivers of local species richness in semi-arid environments. The results can also be used to refine predictions about the response of plant communities to environmental change, and to clarify the relative importance of biotic interactions as drivers of such responses.

AB Positive interactions among plants have rarely been investigated with respect to their evolutionary consequences and vice versa. The outcome of facilitative interactions depends on the competitive ability and stress tolerance of the species. We tested whether this also applies to populations of conspecifics that are locally adapted to different environments and thereby differ in these traits. We hypothesised that ecotypes from less stressful environments experience a greater effect of facilitation when grown in stressful environments compared to populations adapted to these conditions.
   Seeds of two ecotypes of the annual grass species, Brachypodium distachyon, were collected from Mediterranean and arid origins and transplanted at an arid environment within the species' distribution range. To examine the effect of biotic interactions on these ecotypes, we transplanted the individuals with and without the presence of the shrub Gymnocarpos decander (underneath or away from the shrub), and with and without the presence of annual vegetation (removal experiment). We examined the effect of these interactions on the two B. distachyon ecotypes by comparison of emergence success, biomass, and survival to reproduction.
   The presence of shrubs had a positive effect on all three variables in both ecotypes. Facilitation by shrubs enabled individuals from Mediterranean origin to grow and reproduce in arid conditions. Unlike the locals, they failed to survive to reproduction away from the shrubs, because of the markedly shorter growing season in open areas. The annual vegetation did not affect emergence or survival to reproduction in either ecotype; however, the positive effect of shrubs on biomass was reduced in the presence annual vegetation in the Mediterranean ecotype.
   This demonstrates that ecotypes adapted to arid conditions respond differently to these biotic interactions compared to Mediterranean populations. We argue that facilitation may have important evolutionary consequences by enabling maladapted ecotypes to invade and colonize stressful habitats.

AB The McMurdo Dry Valleys are one of the most arid environments on Earth. Over the soil landscape for the majority of the year, biological and ecosystem processes in the dry valleys are constrained by the low temperatures and limited availability of water. The prevalence of these physical limitations in controlling biological and ecosystem processes makes the dry valleys a climate-sensitive system, poised to experience substantial changes following projected future warming. Short-duration increases in summer temperatures are associated with pulses of water from melting ice reserves, including glaciers, snow and permafrost. Such pulses alter soil geochemistry by mobilizing and redistributing soil salts (via enhanced weathering, solubility and mobility), which can alter habitat suitability for soil organisms. Resulting changes in soil community composition or distribution may alter the biogeochemical processes in which they take part. Here, we review the potential impacts of meltwater pulses and present new field data documenting instances of meltwater pulse events that result from different water sources and hydrological patterns, and discuss their potential influence on soil biology and biogeochemistry. We use these examples to discuss the potential impacts of future climate change on the McMurdo Dry Valley soil ecosystem.

AB Ecosystem services are the benefits obtained from the environment that increase human well-being. Economic valuation is conducted by measuring the human welfare gains or losses that result from changes in the provision of ecosystem services. Bats have long been postulated to play important roles in arthropod suppression, seed dispersal, and pollination; however, only recently have these ecosystem services begun to be thoroughly evaluated. Here, we review the available literature on the ecological and economic impact of ecosystem services provided by bats. We describe dietary preferences, foraging behaviors, adaptations, and phylogenetic histories of insectivorous, frugivorous, and nectarivorous bats worldwide in the context of their respective ecosystem services. For each trophic ensemble, we discuss the consequences of these ecological interactions on both natural and agricultural systems. Throughout this review, we highlight the research needed to fully determine the ecosystem services in question. Finally, we provide a comprehensive overview of economic valuation of ecosystem services. Unfortunately, few studies estimating the economic value of ecosystem services provided by bats have been conducted to date; however, we outline a framework that could be used in future studies to more fully address this question. Consumptive goods provided by bats, such as food and guano, are often exchanged in markets where the market price indicates an economic value. Nonmarket valuation methods can be used to estimate the economic value of nonconsumptive services, including inputs to agricultural production and recreational activities. Information on the ecological and economic value of ecosystem services provided by bats can be used to inform decisions regarding where and when to protect or restore bat populations and associated habitats, as well as to improve public perception of bats.

AB The patterns of biodiversity changes in cities are now fairly well established, although diversity changes in temperate cities are much better studied than cities in other climate zones. Generally, plant species richness often increases in cities due to importation of exotic species, whereas animal species richness declines. Abundances of some groups, especially birds and arthropods, often increase in urban areas despite declines in species richness. Although several models have been proposed for biodiversity change, the processes underlying the patterns of biodiversity in cities are poorly understood. We argue that humans directly control plants but relatively few animals and microbes- the remaining biological community is determined by this plant "template" upon which natural ecological and evolutionary processes act. As a result, conserving or reconstructing natural habitats defined by vegetation within urban areas is no guarantee that other components of the biological community will follow suit. Understanding the human-controlled and natural processes that alter biodiversity is essential for conserving urban biodiversity. This urban biodiversity will comprise a growing fraction of the world's repository of biodiversity in the future.

AB Ecologists have long recognized the importance of indirect ecological effects on species abundances, coexistence, and diversity. However, the evolutionary consequences of indirect interactions are rarely considered. Here I conduct selection experiments and examine the evolutionary response of Colpoda sp., a ciliated protozoan, to other members of the inquiline community of purple pitcher plants (Sarracenia purpurea). I measured the evolution of six traits in response to (1) predation by mosquito larvae, (2) competition from other ciliated protozoans, and (3) simultaneous predation and competition. The latter treatment incorporated both direct effects and indirect effects due to interactions between predators and competitors. Population growth rate and cell size evolved in response to direct effects of predators and competitors. However, trait values in the multispecies treatment were similar to those in the monoculture treatment, indicating that direct effects were offset by strong indirect effects on the evolution of traits. For most of the traits measured, indirect effects were opposed to, and often stronger than, direct effects. These indirect effects occurred as a result of behavioral changes of the predator in the presence of competitors and as a result of reduced densities of competitors in the presence of predators. Incorporating indirect effects provides a more realistic description of how species evolve in complex natural communities.

AB Competitive species interactions may contribute to population declines. Purportedly, Red-bellied Woodpeckers (Melanerpes carolinus), a common species, and Red-cockaded Woodpeckers (Picoides borealis), an endangered species, compete for roosting and nesting cavities in living pine trees. To determine whether behavioral interactions measured at the individual level manifest themselves at the population level, we conducted field experiments designed to test whether the presence of Red-bellied Woodpeckers resulted in a decrease in fitness to Red-cockaded Woodpeckers. As part of a 4-year study examining the nature of interspecific interactions in two populations of Red-cockaded Woodpeckers (one stable, the Apalachicola Ranger District; one declining, the Wakulla Ranger District) in the Apalachicola National Forest, Florida, we conducted a set of Red-bellied Woodpecker removal experiments. Paradoxically, following the removal of Red-bellied Woodpeckers, we observed decreases in Red-cockaded Woodpecker group size, proportion of nests that were successful, and proportion of individuals remaining on territories. Removal of Red-bellied Woodpeckers may have exaggerated the immigration rate of Red-bellied Woodpeckers to Red-cockaded Woodpecker territories. The Red-cockaded Woodpeckers in the Apalachicola Ranger District likely can withstand pressure from immigrating Red-bellied Woodpeckers given that their population has remained relatively stable despite the presence of Red-bellied Woodpeckers. A major factor of population persistence in the Wakulla Ranger District was the high turnover rate of adult female Red-cockaded Woodpeckers, a phenomenon that was exacerbated by removal of Red-bellied Woodpeckers. Relying solely on observations of apparently competitive interactions between individuals may not necessarily provide information about population-level outcomes. Paradoxically, removing species that appear to be competitors may harm species of concern.

AB Abiotic factors are considered strong drivers of species distribution and assemblages. Yet these spatial patterns are also influenced by biotic interactions. Accounting for competitors or facilitators may improve both the fit and the predictive power of species distribution models (SDMs). We investigated the influence of a dominant species, Empetrum nigrum ssp. hermaphroditum, on the distribution of 34 subordinate species in the tundra of northern Norway. We related SDM parameters of those subordinate species to their functional traits and their co-occurrence patterns with E. hermaphroditum across three spatial scales. By combining both approaches, we sought to understand whether these species may be limited by competitive interactions and/or benefit from habitat conditions created by the dominant species. The model fit and predictive power increased for most species when the frequency of occurrence of E. hermaphroditum was included in the SDMs as a predictor. The largest increase was found for species that 1) co-occur most of the time with E. hermaphroditum, both at large (i.e. 750 m) and small spatial scale (i.e. 2 m) or co-occur with E. hermaphroditum at large scale but not at small scale and 2) have particularly low or high leaf dry matter content (LDMC). Species that do not co-occur with E. hermaphroditum at the smallest scale are generally palatable herbaceous species with low LDMC, thus showing a weak ability to tolerate resource depletion that is directly or indirectly induced by E. hermaphroditum. Species with high LDMC, showing a better aptitude to face resource depletion and grazing, are often found in the proximity of E. hermaphroditum. Our results are consistent with previous findings that both competition and facilitation structure plant distribution and assemblages in the Arctic tundra. The functional and co-occurrence approaches used were complementary and provided a deeper understanding of the observed patterns by refinement of the pool of potential direct and indirect ecological effects of E. hermaphroditum on the distribution of subordinate species. Our correlative study would benefit being complemented by experimental approaches.

AB Abiotic factors such as climate and soil determine the species fundamental niche, which is further constrained by biotic interactions such as interspecific competition. To parameterize this realized niche, species distribution models (SDMs) most often relate species occurrence data to abiotic variables, but few SDM studies include biotic predictors to help explain species distributions. Therefore, most predictions of species distributions under future climates assume implicitly that biotic interactions remain constant or exert only minor influence on large-scale spatial distributions, which is also largely expected for species with high competitive ability. We examined the extent to which variance explained by SDMs can be attributed to abiotic or biotic predictors and how this depends on species traits. We fit generalized linear models for 11 common tree species in Switzerland using three different sets of predictor variables: biotic, abiotic, and the combination of both sets. We used variance partitioning to estimate the proportion of the variance explained by biotic and abiotic predictors, jointly and independently. Inclusion of biotic predictors improved the SDMs substantially. The joint contribution of biotic and abiotic predictors to explained deviance was relatively small (similar to 9%) compared to the contribution of each predictor set individually (similar to 20% each), indicating that the additional information on the realized niche brought by adding other species as predictors was largely independent of the abiotic (topo-climatic) predictors. The influence of biotic predictors was relatively high for species preferably growing under low disturbance and low abiotic stress, species with long seed dispersal distances, species with high shade tolerance as juveniles and adults, and species that occur frequently and are dominant across the landscape. The influence of biotic variables on SDM performance indicates that community composition and other local biotic factors or abiotic processes not included in the abiotic predictors strongly influence prediction of species distributions. Improved prediction of species' potential distributions in future climates and communities may assist strategies for sustainable forest management.

AB Environmental conditions and biotic interactions are generally thought to influence local species richness. However, immigration and the evolutionary and historical factors that shape regional species pools should also contribute to determining local species richness because local communities arise by assembly from regional species pools. Using the European tree flora as our study system, we implemented a novel approach to assess the relative importance of local and regional mechanisms that control local species richness. We first identified species pools that tolerate particular local environments and quantified the proportion of the pool that is present locally, i.e. the realized/potential (R/P) richness ratio. Because no consensus exists on how to estimate potential richness, we estimated it using three different approaches. Using these three estimates separately and in a combined ensemble estimate, we then analyzed the effects of potential drivers on R/P richness ratios. We predicted that the R/P richness ratio would 1) increase with decreasing distance from glacial refugia (accessibility), 2) and be generally low in geographically fragmented southern Europe because of dispersal limitation; 3) increase with actual evapotranspiration because greater availability of water and energy promotes local population persistence; and 4) increase with topographic heterogeneity because it promotes local species coexistence and facilitates long-term species survival. There was considerable variation among the three R/P richness ratio estimates, but we found consistent support for a negative effect of regional geographic fragmentation and a positive topographic effect. We also identified fairly broad support for the predicted effect of accessibility. We conclude that local tree assemblages in Europe often fail to realize a large proportion of the potential richness held in the regional species pool, partially reflecting their geographical, historical, and environmental circumstances. The dispersal-related effects of geographic fragmentation and accessibility exemplify regional controls that combine with local ecological sorting to determine local species richness.

AB The acquisition of sensory information is central to all species interactions. Most aquatic organisms use chemical cues to assess predation risk and other key ecological factors, but chemoreception may be disrupted in systems with elevated pH. Elevated pH in lakes and rivers is often associated with eutrophication. We used laboratory and mesocosm experiments to test whether elevated pH impairs perception of predation risk by the freshwater snails Physa acuta and Helisoma trivolvis. In one set of experiments, nutrients were added to outdoor mesocosms, resulting in mid-afternoon pH values of 8.5-9.7. Both snail species moved to avoid fish in water with pH < 9.0 but showed no avoidance at higher pH. In a laboratory study, we used buffers to establish six pH treatments ranging from 7.5 to 10.0. At lower pH Physa acuta responded to fish cues by moving into safer habitats, but avoidance became impaired at a pH of 9.4. Helisoma trivolvis also responded to fish at lower pH, and their avoidance behavior became impaired at a pH of 8.8. Given the diversity of aquatic organisms that depend on reception of chemical cues and the broad extent of eutrophication, chemosensory impairment is likely a common occurrence in nature.

AB Nestedness is a useful metric that characterizes the generalist-specialist balance in ecological communities. Although several nestedness indices have been proposed, few have explored how species abundance per se affects their performance and the ability to detect true interaction networks. We here develop a mathematical framework that takes into account abundance in estimates of nestedness. We use an analytical approach to relate abundance and nestedness. In our null model the probability of interaction among species is determined solely as function of their abundances. Assuming a power-law abundance model we analytically find the nestedness index and its coefficient of variability. We find that the sloping abundance distribution of our null model generates more nested structures. On the other hand steeper abundances lead to higher coefficients of variability. Both results suggest that nestedness analysis should be evaluated and explanations sought carefully. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The effect of species diversity on ecosystem function is commonly studied within a single trophic level, but less is known about how resource diversity affects species interactions between trophic levels. We conducted a grazing experiment to determine how resource species diversity affects rates of consumption by three species of freshwater zooplankton consumers. We measured the effect of resource diversity on rates of consumption for several resource community compositions. These compositions varied in terms of palatability for the consumers. The effect of resource diversity on consumption rates depended on the diet breadth of the consumer species (from specialist to generalist) and the community composition of resources. Overall, high resource diversity commonly caused a decline in consumption rates of consumers. The most selective grazer showed reduced consumption for nearly all community compositions, whereas the most generalist grazer showed accelerated consumption when all resource species were palatable. Our results demonstrate that resource species diversity can modulate rates of consumption through the action of multiple different mechanisms.

AB In ecological communities, the outcome of plant-plant interactions represents the net effect of positive and negative interactions occurring above and below ground. Untangling these complex relationships can provide a better understanding of mechanisms that underlie plant-plant interactions and enhance our ability to predict population, community, and ecosystem effects of biotic interactions. In forested ecosystems, tree seedlings interact with established vegetation, but the mechanisms and outcomes of these interactions are not well understood. To explore such mechanisms, we manipulated above-and belowground interactions among tree seedlings, shrubs, and trees and monitored seedling survival and growth of six species (Pinus banksiana, Betula papyrifera, P. resinosa, Quercus rubra, P. strobus, and Acer rubrum) in mature pine-dominated forest in northern Minnesota, USA. The forest had a moderately open canopy and sandy soils. Understory manipulations were implemented in the forest interior and in large gaps and included removal of shrubs (no interactions), tieback of shrubs (belowground), removal of shrubs with addition of shade (aboveground), and unmanipulated shrubs (both below-and aboveground). We found that shrubs either suppressed or facilitated seedling survival and growth depending on the seedling species, source of interaction (e.g., above-or belowground), and ecological context (e.g., gap or forest interior). In general, shrubs strongly influenced survival and growth in gaps, with more modest effects in the forest interior. In gaps, the presence of shrub roots markedly decreased seedling growth and survival, supporting the idea that belowground competition may be more important in dry, nutrient-poor sites. Shrub shade effects were neutral for three species and facilitative for the other three. Facilitation was more likely for shade-tolerant species. In the forest interior, shrub shade negatively affected seedling survival for the most shade-intolerant species. For several species the net effect of shrubs masked the existence of both positive and negative interactions above and below ground. Our results highlight the complexity of plant-plant interactions, demonstrate that outcomes of these interactions vary with the nature of resource limitation and the ecophysiology of the species involved, and suggest that ecological theory that rests on particular notions of plant-plant interactions (e.g., competition) should consider simultaneous positive and negative interactions occurring above and below ground.

AB Facilitation and competition are ecological interactions that are crucial for the organization of plant communities. Facilitative interactions tend to occur among distantly related species, while the strength of competition tends to decrease with phylogenetic distance. The balance between both types of interactions will ultimately determine the specific composition of multispecies associations. Although multispecies patches are the arena in which coexistence develops among different phylogenetic groups within communities, the specific processes that occur across life stages have not been explored. Here we study how different species, in composing discrete patches in central Mexico, exert competitive or facilitative effects on seeds and seedlings. We relate these interactions to phylogenetic relationships among nurse species and beneficiary species, and among members of the patches. Survivorship and growth rates of the columnar cactus Neobuxbaumia mezcalaensis were highly positively related to increasing phylogenetic distance to different nurse species, to the presence of related species in patches, and to mean phylogenetic distances to the rest of the species in the patch. Each of these three elements influenced N. mezcalaensis differently, with different nurse species varying substantially in their early effects on emergence, and the nearest relatives and species composition of patches varying in their late effects on survival and growth. Our results emphasize that evolutionary relationships among co-occurring species in vegetation clumps exert direct and indirect effects on plants, affecting individual performance and species coexistence.

AB There is growing concern that rapid environmental degradation threatens mutualistic interactions. Because mutualisms can bind species to a common fate, mutualism breakdown has the potential to expand and accelerate effects of global change on biodiversity loss and ecosystem disruption. The current focus on the ecological dynamics of mutualism under global change has skirted fundamental evolutionary issues. Here, we develop an evolutionary perspective on mutualism breakdown to complement the ecological perspective, by focusing on three processes: (1) shifts from mutualism to antagonism, (2) switches to novel partners and (3) mutualism abandonment. We then identify the evolutionary factors that may make particular classes of mutualisms especially susceptible or resistant to breakdown and discuss how communities harbouring mutualisms may be affected by these evolutionary responses. We propose a template for evolutionary research on mutualism resilience and identify conservation approaches that may help conserve targeted mutualisms in the face of environmental change.

AB The phylogenetic structure and distribution of functional traits in a community can provide insights into community assembly processes. However, these insights are sensitive to the spatial scale of analysis. Here, we use spatially explicit, neighbourhood models of tree growth and survival for 19 tree species, a highly resolved molecular phylogeny and information on eight functional traits to quantify the relative efficacy of functional similarity and shared ancestry in describing the effects of spatial interactions between tree species on demographic rates. We also assess the congruence of these results with observed phylogenetic and functional structure in the neighbourhoods of live and dead trees. We found strong support for models in which the effects of spatial neighbourhood interactions on tree growth and survival were scaled to species-specific mean functional trait values (e.g., wood specific gravity, leaf succulence and maximum height) but not to phylogenetic distance. The weak phylogenetic signal in functional trait data allowed us to independently interpret the static neighbourhood functional and phylogenetic patterns. We observed greater functional trait similarity in the neighbourhoods of live trees relative to those of dead trees suggesting that environmental filtering is the major force structuring this tree community at this scale while competitive interactions play a lesser role.

AB 1. Fish community structure depends on biotic interactions and abiotic variables. Abiotic variables appear to gain importance in highly variable freshwater systems, such as tropical wetlands where a marked seasonal hydroperiod (dry and wet seasons) modifies water quality and quantity, differentially affecting fish survival and, consequently, modifying species richness and abundance.
   2. We evaluated the relationship between abiotic variables and fish community structure in variable (temporary) and stable (permanent) pools that were interconnected in a tropical wetland with marked annual dry and wet seasons.
   3. All fish species were able to occupy any of the studied pools, but our results showed distinctive fish community structures in permanent and temporary pools. Community structure was related to temperature, depth, pH and macrophyte coverage. Total fish abundance in the wetland was negatively related to water depth and positively related to macrophyte coverage.
   4. Null models of co-occurrence indicated a non-random pattern at the wetland scale and a random pattern within groups of pools with similar characteristics, suggesting that fish communities are structured according to habitat features. We conclude that seasonal abiotic variation and habitat characteristics in this highly variable pristine wetland play major roles in structuring fish communities.

AB Predicted climate change in the Andes will require plant species to migrate upslope to avoid extinction. Central to predictions of species responses to climate change is an understanding of species distributions along environmental gradients. Environmental gradients are frequently modelled as abiotic, but biotic interactions can play important roles in setting species distributions, abundances, and life history traits. Biotic interactions also have the potential to influence species responses to climate change, yet they remain mostly unquantified. An important interaction long studied in tropical forests is postdispersal seed predation which has been shown to affect the population dynamics, community structure, and diversity of plant species in time and space. This paper presents a comparative seed predation study of 24 species of tropical trees across a 2.5 km elevation gradient in the Peruvian Andes and quantifies seed predation variation across the elevational gradient. We then use demographic modelling to assess effects of the observed variation in seed predation on population growth rates in response to observed increasing temperatures in the area. We found marked variation among species in total seed predation depending on the major seed predator of the species and consistent changes in seed predation across the gradient. There was a significant increase in seed survival with increasing elevation, a trend that appears to be driven by regulation of seed predators via top-down forces in the lowlands giving way to bottom-up (productivity) regulation at mid- to high elevations, resulting in a ninefold increase in effective fecundity for trees at high elevations. This potential increase in seed crop size strongly affects modelled plant population growth and seed dispersal distances, increasing population migration potential in the face of climate change. These results also indicate that species interactions can have effects on par with climate in species responses to global change.

TI Predation intensifies parasite exposure in a salmonid food chain

AB 1. Parasites can influence ecosystem structure, function and dynamics by mediating predator-prey interactions. Recurrent infestations of the salmon louse Lepeophtheirus salmonis associated with salmon aquaculture may mediate interactions between juvenile salmonids. Louse infection increases pink salmon Oncorhynchus gorbuscha susceptibility to predation, resulting in the trophic transmission of lice (with an adult male bias) to coho salmon O. kisutch predators. While experimental evidence is accumulating, the extent to which trophic transmission structures the distribution of lice among juvenile salmon in the wild is unknown.
   2. We used a hierarchical modelling approach to examine the abundance and sex ratio of salmon lice on juvenile pink and coho salmon, collected from a region of salmon aquaculture during sea louse infestations, to test the hypothesis that trophic transmission of salmon lice increases infection on coho that feed upon infected pink salmon prey.
   3. As predicted, coho had higher adult and pre-adult louse abundance than their pink salmon prey, and louse abundance was more adult male biased on predators than sympatric prey. We estimate that trophic transmission accounts for 53-67% of pre-adult and adult louse infection on coho.
   4. Synthesis and applications. These results suggest that, by evading predation, salmon lice can accumulate up juvenile salmon food webs. Predators, such as coho, can experience a two-to threefold increase in parasite exposure through predation on infected prey than would otherwise occur through passive exposure to infective larvae. Thus, predation may intensify parasite exposure and undermine the protection to ectoparasites conferred by the larger body size of predators. For larger predatory wild juvenile salmon, the risk of louse transmission from farmed salmon may therefore be greater than previously appreciated. These findings argue for an ecosystem perspective in monitoring and managing the marine environment in areas of intensive salmon aquaculture that includes the productivity and ecological interactions of all salmonid species.

AB 1. Pathogen transmission from open net-pen aquaculture facilities can depress sympatric wild fish populations. However, little is known about the effects of pathogen transmission from farmed fish on species interactions or other ecosystem components. Coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch smolts are susceptible hosts to the parasitic salmon louse Lepeophtheirus salmonis as well as a primary predator of juvenile pink Oncorhynchus gorbuscha salmon, a major host species for lice.
   2. We used a hierarchical model of stock-recruit dynamics to compare coho salmon population dynamics across a region that varies in salmon louse infestation of juvenile coho and their pink salmon prey.
   3. During a period of recurring salmon louse infestations in a region of open net-pen salmon farms, coho salmon productivity (recruits per spawner at low spawner abundance) was depressed approximately sevenfold relative to unexposed populations. Alternate hypotheses for the observed difference in productivity, such as declines in coho prey, perturbations to freshwater habitat or stochasticity, are unlikely to explain this pattern.
   4. Lice parasitizing juvenile coho salmon were likely to be trophically transmitted during predation on parasitized juvenile pink salmon as well as directly transmitted from salmon farms.
   5. Synthesis and applications. The finding that species interactions may cause the effects of pathogen transmission from farmed to wild fish to propagate up a marine food web has important conservation implications: (i) the management of salmon aquaculture should consider and account for species interactions and the potential for these interactions to intensify pathogen transmission from farmed to wild fish, (ii) the ecosystem impact of louse transmission from farmed to wild salmon has likely to have been previously underestimated and (iii) comprehensive monitoring of wild salmon and their population dynamics in areas of intensive salmon aquaculture should be a priority to determine if open net-pen salmon aquaculture is ecologically sustainable.

AB The guava fruit fly, Bactrocera correcta, is widely distributed in Thailand and other surrounding Southeast Asian countries, and, like the closely related sympatric species, the oriental fruit fly, B. dorsalis, infests various fruits, including guava, peach, and mango. Males of both B. correcta and B. dorsalis are strongly attracted to, and compulsively feed on, methyl eugenol (ME). Bactrocera dorsalis males fed on ME sequester its metabolite phenylpropanoids, (E)-coniferyl alcohol and 2-allyl-4,5-dimethoxyphenol, in the rectal pheromone gland. In contrast, B. correcta males fed on ME sequester two different metabolites, (Z)-coniferyl alcohol (ZCF) and (Z)-3,4-dimethoxycinnamyl alcohol (DMC), in the rectal gland. Examination of the temporal changes of ME metabolites in B. correcta male rectal glands revealed that the total of ZCF and DMC was as high as 100 mu g/male at 24 hr after ME feeding. ZCF and DMC were detected in a large proportion of wild B. correcta males captured at various sites in Thailand. Since B. correcta and B. dorsalis are sympatric species in Thailand, these two different subsets of rectal phenylpropanoids could play a role to avoid interbreeding between the species. Further survey of wild flies in Thailand revealed that a large proportion of males of B. correcta store large quantities (over 250 mu g/gland) of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, including beta-caryophyllene, alpha-humulene, and alloaromadendrene in the rectal gland in addition to, or instead of, ZCF and DMC. Laboratory-reared males also sequestered beta-caryophyllene and alpha-humulene, along with ZCF and DMC, when the sesquiterpenes were artificially supplied together with ME. A field test demonstrated that a mixture (1:1) of beta-caryophyllene and alpha-humulene attracted male B. correcta, albeit in smaller numbers than in traps baited with ME. The sequestration of sesquiterpenes, in addition to the different ME metabolites in the pheromone gland in B. correcta males, contrasts with the situation in B. dorsalis males, suggesting a potential role in intra and/or inter-specific interactions between these sympatric species.

TI A framework for understanding physical ecosystem engineering by
   organisms
SO OIKOS
LA English
DT Article
ID DYNAMICS
AB While well-recognized as an important kind of ecological interaction, physical ecosystem engineering by organisms is diverse with varied consequences, presenting challenges for developing and using general understanding. There is also still some uncertainty as to what it is, and some skepticism that the diversity of engineering and its effects is amenable to conceptual integration and general understanding. What then, are the key cause/effect relationships and what underlies them? Here we develop, enrich and extend our extant understanding of physical ecosystem engineering into an integrated framework that exposes the essential cause/effect relationships, their underpinnings, and the interconnections that need to be understood to explain or predict engineering effects. The framework has four cause/effect relationships linking four components: 1. An engineer causes structural change; 2. Structural change causes abiotic change; 3. Structural and abiotic change cause biotic change; 4. Structural, abiotic and biotic change can feedback to the engineer. The first two relationships describe an ecosystem engineering process and abiotic dynamics, while the second two describe biotic consequence for other species and the engineer. The four relationships can be parameterized and linked using time-indexed equations that describe engineered system dynamics. After describing the relationships we discuss the utility of the framework; how it might be enriched; and briefly how it can be used to identify intersections of ecosystem engineering with fields outside ecology.

AB The dynamics of semi-arid plant communities are determined by the Interplay between competition and facilitation among plants The sign and strength of these biotic interactions depend on plant traits However the relationships between plant traits and biotic interactions and the consequences for plant communities are still poorly understood Our objective here was to investigate with a modelling approach the role of plant reproductive traits on biotic interactions and the consequences for processes such as plant succession and invasion The dynamics of two plant types were modelled with a spatially-explicit integrodifferential model (1) a plant with seed dispersal (colonizer of bare soil) and (2) a plant with local vegetative propagation (local competitor) Both plant types were involved in facilitation due to a local positive feedback between vegetation biomass and soil water availability which promoted establishment and growth Plants in the system also competed for limited water The efficiency in water acquisition (dependent on reproductive and growth plant traits) determined which plant type dominated the community at the steady state Facilitative interactions between plant types also played an important role in the community dynamics promoting establishment in the driest conditions and recovery from low biomass Plants with vegetative propagation took advantage of the ability of seed dispersers to establish on bare soil from a low initial biomass Seed dispersers were good invaders maintained high biomass at intermediate and high rainfall and showed a high ability in taking profit from the positive feedback originated by plants with vegetative propagation under the driest conditions However seed dispersers lost competitiveness with an increasing investment in fecundity All together our results showed that reproductive plant traits can affect the balance between facilitative and competitive interactions Understanding this effect of plant traits on biotic interactions provides insights in processes such as plant succession and shrub encroachment (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved

AB The temperate deciduous forest on the northern slopes of the Alborz Mountains has a high biological diversity and many endemic species Huge areas are still old-growth forest but logging and grazing have degraded large parts of the forest These degraded areas have low timber and forage yields and a species composition that differs from its natural state In this study we present an analytical and a numerical solution to the forest management problem by optimizing the benefits of livestock production timber harvest and biodiversity conservation We focus on the ecological interactions rather than on administrative restrictions Our findings are based both on theoretical considerations and field investigations of ecological and economic parameters in Azerbaijan and Iran The results of the numerical optimization suggest that it is optimal to separate timber and livestock production if biodiversity is not valued Livestock rearing is preferable at high discount rates whereas timber production becomes more profitable at low discount rates If the valuation of diversity exceeds a certain threshold a combination of timber production and livestock rearing is socially optimal since it yields a high biological diversity (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved

AB Predicting the relevance of initial colonization and subsequent species interactions for succession in marine sessile communities is difficult because the effects of both factors depend on highly variable environmental processes (e.g. currents, topography, upwelling and others). Depending on the successional stage at which a new species arrives, it can either rapidly colonize in large numbers or its colonization success might be suppressed by resident species. In order to assess the roles of (i) initial colonization and (ii) subsequent species interactions on community development, we examined the succession of fouling assemblages that established on artificial substrata during two different seasonal periods, i.e. austral winter/spring and spring/summer. At 16 weeks of age communities that were initiated in different seasons varied significantly in composition and diversity. During each period (winter/spring and spring/summer), multispecies fouling consortia of different ages (hereafter termed "old" and "young") were reciprocally transplanted between two neighbouring study sites and their succession was documented. After 8 weeks of transplantation communities of different ages maintained their differences in diversity even in the face of environmental change. However, during winter/spring the spreading of the dominant species P. chilensis caused more rapid convergence between all communities at both sites. During the spring/summer period, the high initial abundances of the weak competitor Bugula neritina led to the maintenance of differences between resident and transplanted assemblages within each site. Later colonizers, including the dominant competitor P. chilensis, however, could recruit onto B. neritina and started to spread in the communities. These results suggest that the early and intermediate succession of fouling communities in highly productive marine environments such as the Humboldt Current System is driven by the temporal and spatial variability of propagule supply, while the long-term stability of these communities depends on the identity of colonizers and their competitiveness.

AB Biotic and abiotic interactions between adjacent ecosystems are common and can take the form of resource subsidies or spillover effects of disturbance. These cross-ecosystem exchanges may have significant impacts on the recipient ecosystem by altering the occurrence of strong biotic interactions, such as cannibalism. Cannibalism is ubiquitous and has the potential to be a defining feature in many food webs through impacts on population and community structure. However, there is little empirical evidence detailing how environmental gradients in adjacent ecosystems may alter cannibalism propensity of predators that live on the ecosystem boundary. We investigated cannibalism propensity of a riparian spider across a flooding gradient that altered both the magnitude of an allochthonous prey subsidy to the spider (winged aquatic insects) and spider habitat availability (loose riverbank rocks). Spider density was affected by the interaction of prey and habitat availability across the environmental gradient with small-scale spider densities highest at both stable and disturbed rivers and intermediate at others. Stable isotope analysis of spiders and a mesocosm experiment indicated that cannibalism was higher at stable and disturbed rivers. This demonstrates that an environmental gradient in one system can indirectly alter the propensity for strong biotic interactions of a consumer in an adjacent system through interactive effects of allochthonous and in situ resources.

AB While breeding synchrony among conspecifics is increasingly well understood with regards to the reproductive success of vertebrate and invertebrate taxa, the occurrence of simultaneous multispecies breeding events remains intriguing. The fairly recent discovery of mass annual spawnings in reef corals has provided a first glimpse at putative strategies of reproductive isolation during such events. However, the mechanisms and advantages of same-day heterospecific breeding are still poorly understood and have not yet been investigated in non-coral taxa with different life history strategies. In an effort to bridge this gap, we investigated spawning periodicity and synchrony among 26 sympatric species of free-spawning, capsule-laying, and brood-protecting macroinvertebrates belonging to six different phyla. Twenty-four of these species released gametes or larvae between early March and late April. We analyzed the events over fine temporal scales to test the hypothesis that breeding activities were not random in time or relative to each other. We found that the two main reproductive pulses followed a lunar periodicity and that consistent species- and gender-specific modulations in the timing of spawning occurred during same-day episodes involving up to six free-spawning species. Mass spawning accounts from the literature were reviewed and compared. This work suggests that many species participate in synchronous heterospecific spawning events either because they respond to the same environmental cues or rely on cross-cueing and that reproductive isolation is favored by species-specific circadian patterns, spawning behaviors and cross-gender signaling.

AB Aim
   Urbanization usually leads to biotic homogenization with a decrease in native species and increase in exotic species. We investigated whether local environmental factors in urban water bodies, such as water quality, habitat structure and biotic interactions, influenced the invasion of these systems by exotic macroinvertebrate species.
   Location
   Urban surface water systems in lowlands of the Rhine-Meuse delta.
   Methods
   Presence and abundance of native and exotic macroinvertebrate species were compared between different urban water types and related to environmental variables with multivariate analysis and spearman's correlations. Moreover, co-existence of related native and exotic species was studied.
   Results
   In total nine exotic species were found in the following taxa: Tricladida (1), Crustacea (5), Bivalvia (1) and Gastropoda (2). Taxonomically related native and exotic crustacean species did not seem to be influenced by competition in nutrient-rich urban waters; most species showed high abundances. Nevertheless, two exotic crustacean species were much more abundant in waters where other crustacean species were absent, possibly filling empty niches. Native species richness and abundance was positively related to environmental heterogeneity in the form of submerged vegetation. The occurrence and abundance of most exotic species were positively related to several eutrophication indicators, such as nitrate, sludge layer and lemnid vegetation.
   Main conclusions
   Exotic species in urban waters were mostly detritivorous or omnivorous and therefore dependent on leaf breakdown. In nutrient-rich water systems, where food availability was high, exotic crustacean species co-existed with native crustacean species, while in nutrient-poor, richly vegetated systems, native Asellidae dominated exotic Asellidae. In the turbid water bodies with very little vegetation, native species richness was low and two exotic crustacean species were relatively abundant in these water systems. Invasibility of urban water systems could be reduced by stimulating the development of submerged and nymphaeid vegetation and decreasing nutrient levels.

AB The complexity of ecosystems is staggering, with hundreds or thousands of species interacting in a number of ways from competition and predation to facilitation and mutualism. Understanding the networks that form the systems is of growing importance, e.g. to understand how species will respond to climate change, or to predict potential knock-on effects of a biological control agent. In recent years, a variety of summary statistics for characterising the global and local properties of such networks have been derived, which provide a measure for gauging the accuracy of a mathematical model for network formation processes. However, the critical underlying assumption is that the true network is known. This is not a straightforward task to accomplish, and typically requires minute observations and detailed field work. More importantly, knowledge about species interactions is restricted to specific kinds of interactions. For instance, while the interactions between pollinators and their host plants are amenable to direct observation, other types of species interactions, like those mentioned above, are not, and might not even be clearly defined from the outset. To discover information about complex ecological systems efficiently, new tools for inferring the structure of networks from field data are needed. In the present study, we investigate the viability of various statistical and machine learning methods recently applied in molecular systems biology: graphical Gaussian models, L1-regularised regression with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), sparse Bayesian regression and Bayesian networks. We have assessed the performance of these methods on data simulated from food webs of known structure, where we combined a niche model with a stochastic population model in a 2-dimensional lattice. We assessed the network reconstruction accuracy in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, which was typically in the range between 0.75 and 0.9, corresponding to the recovery of about 60% of the true species interactions at a false prediction rate of 5%. We also applied the models to presence/absence data for 39 European warblers, and found that the inferred species interactions showed a weak yet significant correlation with phylogenetic similarity scores, which tended to weakly increase when including bio-climate covariates and allowing for spatial autocorrelation. Our findings demonstrate that relevant patterns in ecological networks can be identified from large-scale spatial data sets with machine learning methods, and that these methods have the potential to contribute novel important tools for gaining deeper insight into the structure and stability of ecosystems.

AB A major challenge in ecology is to understand how the millions of species on Earth are organized into biological communities. Mechanisms promoting coexistence are one such class of organizing processes, which allow multiple species to persist in the same trophic level of a given web of species interactions. If some mechanism promotes the coexistence of two or more species, each species must be able to increase when it is rare and the others are at their typical abundances; this invasibility criterion is fundamental evidence for species coexistence regardless of the mechanism. In an attempt to evaluate the level of empirical support for coexistence mechanisms in nature, we surveyed the literature for empirical studies of coexistence at a local scale (i.e., species found living together in one place) to determine whether these studies satisfied the invasibility criterion. In our survey, only seven of 323 studies that drew conclusions about species coexistence evaluated invasibility in some way in either observational or experimental studies. In addition, only three other studies evaluated necessary but not sufficient conditions for invasibility (i.e., negative density dependence and a trade-off in performance that influences population regulation). These results indicate that, while species coexistence is a prevalent assumption for why species are able to live together in one place, critical empirical tests of this fundamental assumption of community structure are rarely performed. These tests are central to developing a more robust understanding of the relative contributions of both deterministic and stochastic processes structuring biological communities.

AB In nature, multiple parasite species infect multiple host species and are influenced by processes operating across different spatial and temporal scales. Data sets incorporating these complexities offer exciting opportunities to examine factors that shape epidemics. We present a method using generalized linear mixed models in a multilevel modeling framework to analyze patterns of variances and correlations in binomially distributed prevalence data. We then apply it to a multi-lake, multiyear data set involving two Daphnia host species and nine microparasite species. We found that the largest source of variation in parasite prevalence was the species identities of host-parasite pairs, indicating strong host-parasite specificity. Within host-parasite combinations, spatial variation (among lakes) exceeded interannual variation. This suggests that factors promoting differences among lakes (e. g., habitat characteristics and species interactions) better explain variation in peak infection prevalence in our data set than factors driving differences among years (e. g., climate). Prevalences of parasites in D. dentifera were more positively correlated than those for D. pulicaria, suggesting that similar factors influenced epidemic size among parasites in D. dentifera. Overall, this study demonstrates a method for parsing patterns of variation and covariation in infection prevalence data, providing greater insight into the relative importance of different underlying drivers of parasitism.

AB The influence of negative species interactions has dominated much of the literature on community assembly rules. Patterns of negative covariation among species are typically documented through null model analyses of binary presence/absence matrices in which rows designate species, columns designate sites, and the matrix entries indicate the presence (1) or absence (0) of a particular species in a particular site. However, the outcome of species interactions ultimately depends on population-level processes. Therefore, patterns of species segregation and aggregation might be more clearly expressed in abundance matrices, in which the matrix entries indicate the abundance or density of a species in a particular site.
   We conducted a series of benchmark tests to evaluate the performance of 14 candidate null model algorithms and six covariation metrics that can be used with abundance matrices. We first created a series of random test matrices by sampling a metacommunity from a lognormal species abundance distribution. We also created a series of structured matrices by altering the random matrices to incorporate patterns of pairwise species segregation and aggregation. We next screened each algorithm-index combination with the random and structured matrices to determine which tests had low Type I error rates and good power for detecting segregated and aggregated species distributions. In our benchmark tests, the best-performing null model does not constrain species richness, but assigns individuals to matrix cells proportional to the observed row and column marginal distributions until, for each row and column, total abundances are reached.
   Using this null model algorithm with a set of four covariance metrics, we tested for patterns of species segregation and aggregation in a collection of 149 empirical abundance matrices and 36 interaction matrices collated from published papers and posted data sets. More than 80% of the matrices were significantly segregated, which reinforces a previous meta-analysis of presence/absence matrices. However, using two of the metrics we detected a significant pattern of aggregation for plants and for the interaction matrices (which include plant-pollinator data sets). These results suggest that abundance matrices, analyzed with an appropriate null model, may be a powerful tool for quantifying patterns of species segregation and aggregation.

AB P>A major goal of ecology is to explain differences in species richness between regions and among clades. The diversification rate of clades is a key parameter for understanding both patterns. Here, we combine phylogenetic and climatic data for 250 species of plethodontid salamanders and show for the first time that rapid species diversification is associated with accelerated climatic-niche evolution among species. Both rates are particularly rapid in tropical regions, and where few clades geographically overlap. These results offer a surprising ecological explanation for why diversification rates are often higher in the tropics: rapid shifts between climatic regimes, rather than specific environmental conditions (e.g. high productivity, energy) drive higher diversity. They also suggest that climatic-niche evolution may be particularly rapid in regions where climate is particularly stable. Finally, these results indicate that evolutionary conservatism in climatic niches may be influenced by interactions between species and clades, rather than physiological tolerances alone.

AB P>1. Interest in the effects of biodiversity on ecosystem processes is increasing, stimulated by the global species decline. Different hypotheses about the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF) relationship have been put forward and various underlying mechanisms proposed for different ecosystems.
   2. We investigated BEF relationships and the role of species interactions in laboratory experiments focussing on aquatic decomposition. Species richness at three different trophic levels (leaf detritus, detritus-colonising fungi and invertebrate detritivores) was manipulated, and its effects on leaf mass loss and fungal growth were assessed in two experiments. In the first, monocultures and mixtures of reed (Phragmites australis), alder (Alnus glutinosa) and oak (Quercus cerris) leaf disks were incubated with zero, one or eight fungal species. Leaf mixtures were also incubated with combinations of three and five fungal species. In the second experiment, reed leaf disks were incubated with all eight fungal species and offered to combinations of one, two, three, four or five macroinvertebrate detritivores with different feeding modes.
   3. Results from the first experiment showed that leaf mass loss was directly related to fungal mass and varied unimodally with the number of fungi, with a maximum rate attained at intermediate diversity in oak and reed and at maximum diversity in alder (the fastest decomposing leaf).
   4. Mixing litter species stimulated fungal growth but interactions between species of fungi slowed down decomposition. In contrast, mixtures of macroinvertebrate detritivores reduced fungal mass and accelerated leaf decomposition. Possible explanations of the positive relationship between detritivore diversity and decomposition are a reduction in fungal dominance and a differentiation in the use of different resource patches promoted by higher fungal diversity.
   5. In conclusion, the results show a general increase in decomposition rate with increasing biodiversity that is controlled by within- and between-trophic level interactions, and support the hypothesis of both bottom-up and top-down effects of diversity on this process.

AB Airborne pollen records constitute a suitable bioindicator for evaluating physiological behaviour and resource conservation of vegetation responding to water deficit, reflected in pollination alterations (fluctuations in the dates of the beginning and end of the pollination period), or variation in total pollen production. The effects of extreme climatic conditions, such as increased inter-annual variability of rainfall and reduced rainfall, can be the limiting factors for pollen production and pollination patterns. We explore the effect that seasonal and inter-annual variation in climatic patterns (emphasizing the alteration of rainfall regimes) exert on pollination pattern in six anemophilous taxa located in the semi-arid area of Almeria (SE Spain), which is considered to be one of the areas with the highest aridity index in Europe. The sampling in a temporal series of 8 years (1998-2005) showed the pulsed and discrete rainfall events interspersed with drought periods are closely related to the alteration of the pollination in certain species. This is manifested in: (i) delayed onset of flowering until reaching the minimum threshold of soil water, in the case of some annual plants (Plantago, Rumex, and Poaceae), or (ii) scant variability both in the flowering period in plants with drought tolerance (Chenopodiaceae and Artemisia) or plants often linked to soil-moisture availability (Urticaceae).

AB Aim
   To compare post-eruption biotic recolonization times on mainland and island volcanoes.
   Location
   The research involved the study of the recolonization kinetics of Mt Vesuvius (a mainland volcano in southern Italy) and the Island of Vulcano (southern Italy). Comparisons were also made with Jorullo Volcano (Mexico) and Mount St Helens (USA) (two mainland volcanoes) and with Krakatau (Indonesia) (an island volcano).
   Methods
   Island volcanoes are expected to possess inherently impoverished faunas and floras, and recolonization after eruption is expected to occur to a low level. In comparison, the recolonization kinetics for a mainland volcano should be characterized by a higher plateau of species, and by species with low dispersal ability. To test this model, recolonization times after the small-scale Plinian eruption of 1631 were calculated for various insect groups of Mt Vesuvius and compared with recolonization times calculated for the Island of Vulcano, which erupted dramatically in 1888. For this purpose, thorough insect checklists, based on exhaustive samplings, were extracted from the literature. Results obtained from Mt Vesuvius and Vulcano were also compared with recolonization times calculated for biotas of other mainland and island volcanoes.
   Results
   Insect recolonization times from the 1631 Vesuvius eruption varied according to the ecology of the animal group considered and appeared very long when compared with those obtained for the island volcano of Vulcano. Results obtained from Vulcano also suggest the possibility that this island hosts more species than expected at equilibrium, a state of affairs also found for the butterflies of Krakatau.
   Main conclusions
   In keeping with the predictions of multi-phase models developed in island biogeography theory, island volcanoes have a lower species richness at equilibrium than do mainland volcanoes, but might host, in a first phase of recolonization, more species than expected at equilibrium, because ecological space is unsaturated and inter-specific interactions are limited. The lower isolation of mainland volcanoes (allowing higher immigration rates) leads to higher rates and longer periods of recolonization and hence to higher species richness at equilibrium.

AB Aim
   This paper examines eight fossil pollen datasets from Romania with the aim of exploring regional and elevational patterns in site similarity throughout the Holocene. In particular, we aim to determine whether there are clear intervals of homogenization/differentiation and to ascertain the potential driving factors.
   Location
   Romania.
   Methods
   Qualitative (pollen diagrams) and numerical methods including principal components analysis and Bray-Curtis similarity analyses were used.
   Results
   We found strong variability in the past vegetation dynamics during the Holocene. Bray-Curtis similarity analyses show large fluctuations in vegetation similarity and distinct periods of homogenization and differentiation throughout the Holocene. The magnitude and length of these periods appear quite variable in time, but the significant ones can be delimited as follows: (1) differentiation between 11,250 and 11,000 cal. yr bp, 10,000 and 9750 cal. yr bp, 6000 and 5750 cal. yr bp, 2500 and 2250 cal. yr bp, and especially over the last 200 years; and (2) homogenization between 9750 and 9500 cal. yr bp, and 2750 and 2500 cal. yr bp, with more stable periods between 9000 and 7750 cal. yr bp, 4750 and 3500 cal. yr bp, and 2000 and 1000 cal. yr bp.
   Main conclusions
   First, periods of biotic homogenization that occurred before significant anthropogenic impact on vegetation demonstrate that not all homogenization is a product of anthropogenic change: it can also be driven by natural causes. In fact, recent human impact (over the last 200 years) appears to have resulted in increased regional differentiation and not in homogenization - a result that contradicts most studies based on more modern, short-term records. Second, both abiotic (climate and disturbance) and biotic factors are likely drivers of intervals of differentiation and homogenization. We suggest that differentiation may be triggered primarily by climate changes and disturbances (mostly natural pre-2500 cal. yr bp and human-induced thereafter), whereas homogenization may be driven predominantly by biotic interactions (e.g. immigration and interspecific competition). Third, this long-term study raises awareness that assessments of pattern in vegetation homogenization/differentiation may depend on the specific time period and length of investigation. Long-term investigations through multiple generations are likely to yield particularly useful information on the mechanisms and effects of biotic homogenization.

AB 1. The dispersal capabilities of most plant species remain unknown. However, gaining basic dispersal information is a critical step for understanding species' geographical distributions and for predicting the likely impacts of future climate change. Dispersal mechanisms can indicate shortor long-distance dispersers, and highlight important biological interactions.
   2. To predict dispersal mechanisms for species where information is limited, we used generalized linear mixed models with basic life-history and ecological traits. Sets of models were created ( using Australian species) for six dispersal categories: wind, unassisted, water, ant, vertebrate-ingestion and vertebrate-attachment dispersal mechanisms. We validated our models on the dispersal mechanisms of 50 Australian, 30 Californian, 30 Swiss plant species and a global compilation of 70 species.
   3. Growth form, seed mass and vegetation type were the main predictor variables. Our models predicted dispersal mechanisms for Australian and Californian plant species equally well ( c. 70% correct) and to a lesser extent for the Swiss flora ( c. 50% correct). Our models predicted observed dispersal mechanisms ( c. 50% correct) equally well to inferred dispersal mechanisms ( based on seed morphology).
   4. Synthesis. Our approach of using easily obtainable traits for predicting dispersal mechanisms of species allows dispersal information to be predicted for species where little is known. From here, the application of realistic dispersal curves to the predicted dispersal mechanisms will further understanding on the dispersal capabilities of species.

AB 1. Ecological communities are assembled as complex networks of both positive (i.e. facilitation) and negative (i.e. competition) interactions. In networks established among plant species, many facilitative interactions occurring between a benefactor - a nurse - and a beneficiary - a facilitated seedling - turn into competition over time as the facilitated seedling grows and outcompetes the nurse. The facilitative associations that disappear over time are mainly restricted to closely related taxa, because close relatives tend to share niche requirements and compete more strongly for the same resources. In consequence, the phylogenetic structure of a network might change as positive associations become negative.
   2. This study is aimed to characterize how the overall (i.e. nestedness and connectance) and the phylogenetic structure of facilitation networks in semi-arid communities change when facilitation turns into competition and some of the early species associations established by facilitation disappear.
   3. We show that the initial facilitation networks retain the overall, but not the phylogenetic, structure. Phylogenetic analyses show that as seedlings, facilitated species tend to associate with the same subset of nurses while, on the contrary, nurses are indifferent to the identity of their facilitated seedlings. But when competition becomes important, closely related nurse species appear associated with only a subset of facilitated species in the community.
   4. Synthesis. Temporal rearrangements in the phylogenetic structure of the facilitation networks provide evidence that plant-plant species interactions lead to highly species-specific networks in which the phylogenetic history has a pervasive influence not only on recruitment but also on adult community composition. The use of phylogenetic methods combined with complex network approaches opens the possibility to understand the complexity of ecological interactions occurring in nature as for example those occurring when biological invasions take place or those producing coextinction cascades following species removal from ecosystems.

AB The steps by which neutral, random and/or negative biological interactions evolve into mutualistic ones remain poorly understood. Here, we study Elacatinus gobies and the 'client' fishes they clean. Colourful stripes are common to mutualist cleaners and noncleaning sister species. Blue stripes are unique to cleaners and are more conspicuous to predators than are basal yellow or green stripes. In turn, we focused on the role of colour as a potentially specialized signal. We show that cleaners may possess a chemical defence and demonstrate that stripes are sufficient to elicit client posing behaviour and to deter attack, corroborating the putative role of chemistry. Analysis of previously published records shows that yellow cleaners interact with predatory clients less often compared to green and blue cleaners. Our results highlight evolution from predator resistance to advertising with conspicuous signals. Similar trajectories, via recognizable signals to risky partners, may be common in other diffuse mutualisms.

AB An increasing number of studies have demonstrated phenotypic plasticity in brain size and architecture in response to environmental variation. However, our knowledge on how brain architecture is affected by commonplace ecological interactions is rudimentary. For example, while intraspecific competition and risk of predation are known to induce adaptive plastic modifications in morphology and behaviour in a wide variety of organisms, their effects on brain development have not been studied. We studied experimentally the influence of density and predation risk on brain development in common frog (Rana temporaria) tadpoles. Tadpoles grown at low density and under predation risk developed smaller brains than tadpoles at the other treatment combinations. Further, at high densities, tadpoles developed larger optic tecta and smaller medulla oblongata than those grown at low densities. These results demonstrate that ecological interactions - like intraspecific competition and predation risk - can have strong effects on brain development in lower vertebrates.

AB The response of animal communities to habitat quality and fragmentation may vary depending on microhabitat associations of species. For example, sensitivity of species to woody habitat fragmentation should increase with their degree of association with woody plants. We investigated effects of local and landscape factors on spider communities in different microhabitats within Swiss apple orchards. We expected a stronger negative effect of woody habitat fragmentation on spiders inhabiting tree canopies compared to spiders living in the meadow. The 30 orchards that we sampled varied in woody habitat amount and isolation at landscape and patch scales. Local factors included management intensity and plant diversity. Spiders associated with meadow were affected by plant diversity, but not by fragmentation. In contrast, spiders associated with canopies responded to isolation from other woody habitats. Surprisingly, we found both positive and negative effects of habitat isolation on local abundance. This indicates that differences in dispersal and/or biotic interactions shape the specific response to habitat isolation. The relative importance of local and landscape factors was in accordance with the microhabitat of the spiders. Thus, considering microhabitat associations can be important for identifying processes that would be overlooked if sampling were pooled for the whole habitat.

AB Recent research has shown that many mutualistic communities display non-random structures. While our understanding of the structural properties of mutualistic communities continues to improve, we know little of the biological variables resulting in them. Mutualistic communities include those formed between ants and extrafloral (EF) nectar-bearing plants. In this study, we examined the contributions of plant and ant abundance, plant and ant size, and plant EF nectar resources to the network structures of nestedness and interaction frequency of ant-plant networks across five sites within one geographic locality in the Sonoran Desert. Interactions between ant and plant species were largely symmetric. That is, ant and plant species exerted nearly equivalent quantitative interaction effects on one another, as measured by their frequency of interaction. The mutualistic ant-plant networks also showed nested patterns of structure, in which there was a central core of generalist ant and plant species interacting with one another and few specialist-specialist interactions. Abundance and plant size and ant body size were the best predictors of symmetric interactions between plants and ants, as well as nestedness. Despite interactions in these communities being ultimately mediated by EF nectar resources, the number of EF nectaries had a relatively weak ability to explain variation in symmetric interactions and nestedness. These results suggest that different mechanisms may contribute to structure of bipartite networks. Moreover, our results for ant-plant mutualistic networks support the general importance of species abundances for the structure of species interactions within biological communities.

AB The metacommunity concept has proved to be a valuable tool for studying how space can affect the properties and assembly of competitive communities. However, the concept has not been as extensively applied to the study of food webs or trophically structured communities. Here, we demonstrate how to develop a modelling framework that permits food webs to be considered from a spatial perspective. We do this by broadening the classic metapopulation patch-dynamic framework so that it can also account for trophic interactions between many species and patches. Unlike previous metacommunity models, we argue that this requires a system of equations to track the changing patch occupancy of the various species interactions, not the patch occupancy of individual species. We then suggest how this general theoretical framework can be used to study complex and spatially extended food web metacommunities.

AB Recent work has shown that antagonist (e.g. predator-prey food web) and mutualist (e.g. pollinator-plant) network structure can be altered by global environmental change drivers, and that these alterations may have important ecosystem-level consequences. This has prompted calls for the conservation of network structure, but precisely which attributes of webs should be conserved remains unclear. Further, the extent to which network metrics characterise the spatiotemporally-variable dynamic structure of interacting communities is unknown. Here, we summarise the attributes of web structure that are predicted to confer stability or increased function to a system, as these may be of greatest interest to conservation biologists. However, empirical evaluation of these effects is lacking in most cases, and we discuss whether stability is even desirable in all contexts. The incorporation of web attributes into conservation monitoring requires that changes in these attributes can be recorded (sampled) with relative ease. We contrast the sensitivity of metrics to sampling effort, and highlight those (such as nestedness and connectance) that could easily be incorporated into conservation monitoring. Despite our growing understanding of the characteristics of food webs that confer stability and function, numerous practical challenges need to be overcome before the goal of conserving species interaction networks can be achieved.

AB Establishment failure by immigrant species, while believed to be a common occurrence, is difficult to observe and so factors contributing to failure are poorly explored. Human mediated disturbance is a key element in facilitating biological invasions, but its role in preventing establishment is rarely considered. In Australia, the whitefly, Bemisia tabaci biotype B was first detected in 1994 and has since spread widely and displaced an indigenous competitor. However, in one location it has failed to establish permitting an indigenous competitor to persist. In this area, the dominant plant host is Euphorbia cyathophora. Through a combination of laboratory and field experimentation we show that while both can utilise the young, upper leaves only the indigenous competitor can use the older lower leaves. We then demonstrate that the removal of the upper leaves as part of foreshore vegetation management is the key factor in preventing the establishment of the invader and subsequent displacement of its competitor. While human mediated disturbance coupled with complex biological interactions may promote invasion they may equally well retard rather than facilitate invasion, a factor that appears to have been largely ignored. Complexities of this kind must be conceived in our thinking to achieve a comprehensive understanding of biological invasion.

   COOCCURRENCE
AB Assembly rules have been difficult to observe partly because species interactions vary with resource availability, the amount of disturbance, and species richness. Using bird survey data from two years in five regions of SE Australia (463 sites), we tested six predictions from assembly rules theory. We developed generalised linear models for all pair-wise species comparisons within a region, after first taking vegetation differences among sites into account. We found: 1) that disturbed and fragmented agricultural landscapes had more negative relationships because aggressive honeyeaters monopolised patches; 2) differences between wet and dry years (high and low resources) were attributed to emigration, immigration, and reduced intensity of negative interactions in the dry year, and not to more intense competition; 3) although negative correlations were expected among ecologically-similar species, we observed the opposite pattern with significant positive associations in fragmented landscapes; 4) relationships involving aggressive honeyeaters led to more negative relationships as predicted; however, this was only observed in fragmented landscapes and was not significant in every year; 5) in two agricultural landscapes, there were fewer negative relationships in low species-richness sites, probably because one species from each pair had low abundance. This enabled us to suggest dominance relationships among species pairs; 6) there was evidence of more negative relationships in low-disturbance sites in agricultural landscapes as predicted. However, instead of the mechanism predicted by theory (reduced disruption allowing assembly processes to approach equilibrium), we suggest that sites with low disturbance represent resources worthy of defence by dominant species. We conclude that bird communities in SE Australia are rarely limited by negative species interactions, although aggressive honeyeaters are a feature of fragmented landscapes. However, diverse mechanisms underlie the temporal and spatial variation in species interactions when they do occur, meaning that simple statements of assembly rules may not be useful in these systems.

AB In this paper, we investigated the patterns of habitat use in three sibling species of larks: the Thekla lark Galerida theklae which is sympatric with either of two parapatric species of crested larks (G. macrorhyncha replacing G. cristata in arid areas of Morocco). Specifically, we addressed the following questions: 1) do species show niche conservatism in space (France vs Morocco) and time (breeding vs winter period)? 2) Does habitat use change at different interspecific densities? 3) Which factors drive the narrow range limit between G. cristata and G. macrorhyncha? We found that G. theklae was strongly associated with sloping and rocky (rugged) habitats in comparison with crested larks, but habitat use was not entirely consistent in space and time. Evidences for ecological displacement were mitigated. In the only habitat shared by G. cristata and G. theklae in France (vineyards surrounded by low shrubland), we observed a one-third increase of G. theklae from nearby garrigues in winter, which coincided with a significant decrease of G. cristata after we controlled for density changes in non-shared habitats. However, in Morocco, the use of rugged habitats by G. theklae was not affected by the prevalence of G. cristata or G. macrorhyncha in surrounding areas, at least at the spatial scales investigated. Our results suggest that interspecific competition plays a role in the parapatric distribution of G. cristata and G. macrorhyncha, because: 1) the alternative of a recent contact receives little support; 2) transition between species coincides with aridity gradients but not with topographic barriers or a sharp ecotone; 3) G. cristata also occurs in arid areas wherein G. macrorhyncha is rare or absent. Overall, our results add support to the view that a better integration of biotic interactions and spatio-temporal variations in ecological niches might increase the predictive power of ecological niche models.

AB The effects of chemicals on biotic interactions, such as competition and predation, have rarely been investigated in aquatic ecotoxicology. This study presents a new approach for the investigation of predator prey interactions between zebrafish (Danio rerio) and midge larvae (Chironomus riparius) impaired by chlorpyrifos (CHP), a neurotoxic insecticide. With a simple experimental design including four different treatments: (1) control, (2) predator exposed, (3) prey exposed and (4) both, predator and prey, exposed, we were able to detect by visual observation an increase in the feeding rate of zebrafish preying on exposed chironomids after acute (2 h) exposure to 6 mu g/l CHP. Previously, a decrease in the burrowing behaviour of exposed chironomid larvae was observed. However, when pre-exposing simultaneously both predators and prey, no significant differences in the feeding rate of zebrafish were observed. This suggests an impairment in prey recognition of the exposed zebrafish. At a lower CHP concentration (1 mu g/l), no differences in feeding rate of zebrafish were observed. We therefore propose the use of trophic interactions as parameters in higher tier studies for chemical testing and evaluation of ecotoxicological risk assessment.

AB We revisited a growth-form removal experiment after 12 years with the aim to compare the long-term population responses of three shrub species. Specifically, we were interested to know if the resource partitioning and plant interactions act as complementary mechanisms of the shrub-grass coexistence. In 1983 different plots from grass-shrub Patagonian steppes were submitted to three treatments: control, grass-, and shrub-removal during three consecutive years. In 1997 we studied nine plots from the original experiment and recorded all shrubs to compare shrub density, population size structure, vitality, spatial patterns and neighbourhood interferences of three native and co-dominant shrub species: Mulinum spinosum, Senecio filaginoides, and Adesmia volckmanni. After 12 years of recovery, shrubs as a growth-form group, fully re-established in plots where they were removed and attained 75% higher density in grass-removal plots than in control plots. However, long-term population responses of Mulinum, Senecio, and Adesmia to removals were distinctive. On the other hand, negative and positive interferences among shrub species and between shrubs and grasses generated a complex network. Morphological and functional differences in shrub and grass species and their interactions at population level and long-term could be a key to achieve a better comprehension of shrub-grass coexistence from semi-arid ecosystems.

AB Aim The aim of community-level modelling is to improve the performance of species distributional models by taking patterns of co-occurrence among species into account. Here, we test this expectation by examining how well three community-level modelling strategies ('assemble first, predict later', 'predict first, assemble later', and 'assemble and predict together') spatially project the observed composition of species assemblages.
   Location Europe.
   Methods Variation in the composition of European tree assemblages and its spatial and environmental correlates were examined with cluster analysis and constrained analysis of principal coordinates. Results were used to benchmark spatial projections from three community-based strategies: (1) assemble first, predict later (cluster analysis first, then generalized linear models, GLMs); (2) predict first, assemble later (GLMs first, then cluster analysis); and (3) assemble and predict together (constrained quadratic ordination).
   Results None of the community-level modelling strategies was able to accurately model the observed distribution of tree assemblages in Europe. Uncertainty was particularly high in southern Europe, where modelled assemblages were markedly different from observed ones. Assembling first and predicting later led to distribution models with the simultaneous occurrence of several types of assemblages in southern Europe that do not co-occur, and the remaining strategies yielded models with the presence of non-analogue assemblages that presently do not exist and that are much more strongly correlated with environmental gradients than with the real assemblages.
   Main conclusions Community-level models were unable to characterize the distribution of European tree assemblages effectively. Models accounting for co-occurrence patterns along environmental gradients did not outperform methods that assume individual responses of species to climate. Unrealistic assemblages were generated because of the models' inability to capture fundamental processes causing patterns of covariation among species. The usefulness of these forms of community-based models thus remains uncertain and further research is required to demonstrate their utility.

AB Aim
   To evaluate how factors acting at different spatial scales influence range limits in bird species of the Colombian Andes.
   Location
   Andes Mountains of Colombia.
   Methods
   We used Maxent, a climate envelope model (CEM), and environmental and geographic information to study range-filling (i.e. the extent to which a species occurs in all the areas in which it is predicted to occur) in 70 range-restricted bird species of the Colombian Andes. Environmental data were taken from the WorldClim database, and species occurrence data were taken from museum data collated by the BioMap project, an observational database, and the literature. We evaluated how climate and geographic barriers may shape range limits at two scales.
   Results
   At a broad extent (i.e. across the three main cordilleras within the Colombian Andes), we find that CEMs predict there to be suitable environmental conditions for particular species in regions where the species is absent, possibly as a result of dispersal limitation or biotic interactions. In contrast, at a finer scale (within a given cordillera), species generally occur across the entire area predicted to be suitable by a given CEM. Geographic discontinuities within cordilleras do not generally correspond to range limits; instead, range limits correspond to changes in environmental conditions.
   Main conclusions
   Our results suggest that different mechanisms influence the presence of species at different scales. Dispersal limitation, potentially combined with species interactions, may influence range limits at a broad extent (the entire Colombian Andes), while strong environmental gradients correspond to range limits at a finer scale (within a cordillera).

AB Muscodor yucatanensis, an endophytic fungus, was isolated from the leaves of Bursera simaruba (Burseraceae) in a dry, semideciduous tropical forest in the Ecological Reserve El Eden, Quintana Roo, Mexico. We tested the mixture of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by M. yucatanensis for allelochemical effects against other endophytic fungi, phytopathogenic fungi and fungoids, and plants. VOCs were lethal to Guignardia mangifera, Colletotrichum sp., Phomopsis sp., Alternaria solani, Rhizoctonia sp., Phytophthora capsici, and P. parasitica, but had no effect on Fusarium oxysporum, Xylaria sp., the endophytic isolate 120, or M. yucatanensis. VOCs inhibited root elongation in amaranth, tomato, and barnyard grass, particularly those produced during the first 15 days of fungal growth. VOCs were identified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and included compounds not previously reported from other Muscodor species and the previously reported compounds octane, 2-methyl butyl acetate, 2-pentyl furan, caryophyllene, and aromadendrene. We also evaluated organic extracts from the culture medium and mycelium of M. yucatanensis on the same endophytes, phytopathogens, and plants. In general, extracts inhibited plants more than endophytic or phytopathogens fungi. G. mangifera was the only organism that was significantly stimulated by both extracts regardless of concentration. Compounds in both organic extracts were identified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. We discuss the possible allelopathic role that metabolites of M. yucatanensis play in its ecological interactions with its host plant and other organisms.

TI Does post-fire abiotic habitat filtering create divergent plant

AB We investigated the role of post-fire residual organic matter (ROM) thickness as a driver of community assembly in eastern Newfoundland. We hypothesized that if post-fire community assembly is predominantly controlled by ROM thickness (an abiotic habitat filter), then post-fire species composition and functional traits should correspond to the depth and distribution of ROM. However, if species interactions (biotic filter) are the primary constraints on community assembly, then post-fire species composition and their functional traits should be independent of the depth and distribution of ROM. We tested these predictions in three relatively mature plant communities, Kalmia angustifolia heath, black spruce (Picea mariana)-Kalmia shrub savannah and black spruce forest. Through pre-fire stand reconstruction, we found evidence that the three communities originated from black spruce forest. ROM thickness in heath was almost twice that of shrub savannah and six times more than forest, suggesting a gradient in fire severity. Distribution of ROM corresponded to patterns in vegetation dominance, where thick ROM (> 2 cm) filtered out black spruce in favour of Kalmia. ROM thickness was a strong predictor of vegetation composition and function between heath and forest, but this was not found between the shrub savannah and forest. We attribute this to species interactions and allelopathy, which may have become important when ROM thickness was suitable for both seed (black spruce) and vegetative (Kalmia) regenerating species. Thus, priority effects or "who came first" may have lead to shrub savannah formation when ROM thickness was similar to 2 cm. We conclude that abiotic habitat filtering of thick ROM (> 2 cm) on (primarily) species' regeneration traits was the primary driver of community divergence from forest to heath and shrub savannah.

AB In recent years the importance of facilitative interactions in ecological communities is increasingly recognized. This phenomenon has been observed repeatedly, particularly in vegetation communities, in a wide range of environmental conditions. The current hypothesis predicts that the role of facilitation becomes increasingly important in conjunction with increasing stress. Several empirical studies, however, failed to detect such patterns, particularly at the extreme ends of the stress gradients. Herein, we present a conceptual model that may resolve discrepancies between expected and observed and provides a more precise framework of the existing hypotheses. By relaxing two common assumptions commonly used by the stress-gradient hypothesis (SGH) we are able to demonstrate that under some circumstances the importance of facilitation may be less at the extreme ends of these gradients. Namely, we first re-emphasize the notion that physiological response is not linear with respect to environmental changes along stress gradients. Second, it is argued that the net outcome of facilitative and competitive interactions is reflected in the fitness of individuals as a product of these two processes, in contrast to the commonly applied assumption of additivity. Accordingly, a synthesis of the concepts of population biology (measures of fitness) and plant physiology (nonlinear responses) with the stress gradient hypothesis while retaining the original simplicity of the SGH model contributes to a better specification of the predictions of the stress-gradient hypothesis and the resolution of observed contradictions.

AB Alpine snowbeds are habitats where the major limiting factors for plant growth are herbivory and a small time window for growth due to late snowmelt. Despite these limitations, snowbed vegetation usually forms a dense carpet of palatable plants due to favourable abiotic conditions for plant growth within the short growing season. These environmental characteristics make snowbeds particularly interesting to study the interplay of facilitation and competition. We hypothesised an interplay between resource competition and facilitation against herbivory. Further, we investigated whether these predicted neighbour effects were species-specific and/or dependent on ontogeny, and whether the balance of positive and negative plant-plant interactions shifted along a snowmelt gradient. We determined the neighbour effects by means of neighbour removal experiments along the snowmelt gradient, and linear mixed model analyses. The results showed that the effects of neighbour removal were weak but generally consistent among species and snowmelt dates, and depended on whether biomass production or survival was considered. Higher total biomass and increased fruiting in removal plots indicated that plants competed for nutrients, water, and light, thereby supporting the hypothesis of prevailing competition for resources in snowbeds. However, the presence of neighbours reduced herbivory and thereby also facilitated survival. For plant growth the facilitative effects against herbivores in snowbeds counterbalanced competition for resources, leading to a weak negative net effect. Overall the neighbour effects were not species-specific and did not change with snowmelt date. Our finding of counterbalancing effects of competition and facilitation within a plant community is of special theoretical value for species distribution models and can explain the success of models that give primary importance to abiotic factors and tend to overlook interrelations between biotic and abiotic effects on plants.

AB In the face of global decline in biodiversity, the relationship between diversity and species interactions deserves particular attention. If pollinators are strongly dependent on floral diversity due to mutual specialization, declines in plant diversity, e.g. caused by land use intensification, may be associated with linked extinctions of pollinators. However, the general extent of pollinator specialization is still poorly known. To explore the dependence of local bee and hoverfly communities on flower diversity, we recorded flower supply and flower-visiting insects on 27 meadows with varying flower diversity in southern Germany and analyzed (a) whether the diversity of flower visitors is correlated with flower diversity, (b) whether the degree of dietary specialization of flower visitors changes with flower diversity and (c) whether flower preferences of individual flower visitor species are constant or variable between different communities. Flower-visitor interaction webs were compiled during a single day on each meadow. This approach prevents relating pollinator species to flowers they never encounter because of non-overlapping phenology or spatial segregation. (a) Flower diversity and flower visitor diversity were positively correlated. (b) Flower visitor assemblies were significantly specialized at a relatively high level, contrasting to the opinion that plant-pollinator webs are highly generalized, and providing a possible explanation for the positive diversity correlation. However, the level of specialization did not change significantly across the gradient of flower diversity, suggesting that pollinators are partitioned to a similar extent in each meadow. (c) In the analysis of ten common flower visitor species previously categorized as generalists, strong evidence was found for both, consistent preferences and preferences that differ between sites. These results indicate a flexibility in flower preferences and a dynamic resource partitioning among pollinators. Generally, our findings highlight the complexity of plant-pollinator interactions and confirm the importance of flower diversity for bee and hoverfly communities.

AB Coexistence of woody and herbaceous plants may be governed by a complex set of direct and indirect interactions, whose relative importance have been rarely assessed. We experimentally studied woody species establishment in a mixed plant community by disentangling the potential role of such biotic interactions and the effect of environmental variations on them. Seedling establishment of the common eastern Mediterranean shrub species Sarcopoterium spinosum was investigated under different rainfall and light conditions, combined with the effect of the presence of adult shrubs and annual neighbors. We predicted that seedlings will be directly affected by competition with annuals with increasing water availability, while direct effects of adult shrubs will be positive via amelioration of water stress. Indirect effects were expected beneath shrub canopies due to reduced water stressed and light availability for both annuals and shrub seedlings, which may intensify competition between annuals and shrub seedlings. To test these predictions we performed field and garden experiments in which we combined manipulation of shrub and annual presence with manipulations of water availability and light conditions to simulate the effect of shrub canopy. In contrast to our prediction, shrub seedling establishment was not facilitated but inhibited by adult shrubs because of light limitation. As expected, annuals had direct negative effects on shrub seedlings under wet conditions, which shifted to neutral or positive effects under dry conditions. Thus, interactions among shrubs and annuals, and in particular the release from competition during drought years, leads to a counterintuitive positive effect of drought on shrub seedling establishment. Our findings point to the importance of experimentally studying multidimensional interactions for coexistence of different life forms and to the underestimated role of light for success in water-limited ecosystems.

AB In coasts bordering highly productive seas, there can be a flux of resources to the terrestrial ecosystem, and terrestrial carnivores can use marine prey extensively. Two native, endangered species (otter Lontra provocax and culpeo fox Pseudalopex culpaeus lycoides) and two exotic species (mink Neovison vison and grey fox Pseudalopex griseus) inhabit the Beagle coast. The objectives of this paper are: (1) to describe the diet, habitat use and distribution of otters, mink and foxes on the coast of the Beagle channel and (2) to discuss the role of marine resources in the ecological interactions among these species. Diet was determined from the analysis of 245 faeces, and distribution was established from sign surveys. Marine prey occurred in the scats of 98.3, 70.4, 35.5 and 18.2% of otters, mink, culpeo and grey foxes, respectively. Other terrestrial species also use marine resources in Southern Patagonia. All this evidence suggests that the Fueguian coastal channels provide an illuminating example of allochthonous food subsidies from the sea. In the community of four sympatric predators, two native (and endangered) and two exotic, coexistence appears to be facilitated by a renewing marine food subsidy.

AB An abundance index of an eastern Quebec population of North American porcupines (Erethizon dorsatum) has cycled with superimposed periodicities of 11 and 22 years from 1868 to 2000. This cycle closely followed 11- and 22-year cycles in solar irradiance and local weather (e.g., winter precipitation and spring temperature), generating the hypothesis that solar activity may affect porcupine abundance through effects on local weather. We investigated the mechanisms linking porcupine abundance to local weather conditions using a 6-year study (2000-2005) involving individual mark-recapture, radio tracking, seasonal survival analyses and identification of mortality causes. Summer (May-August) survival was high and constant over the study period, whereas winter (August-May) survival was lower and varied during the duration of our study. Variations in local winter precipitation explained 89% of the variation in winter survival. Porcupine predation rates appeared strongly related to snow conditions; 95% of depredated porcupines were killed when snow was covering the ground, and predation rates were higher in years with increased winter precipitation. Our data thus support the hypothesis that changes in predation rates under different snow conditions were the mechanism relating climate to porcupine population dynamics, via modifications of the local predator-prey interactions and impacts on porcupine winter survival. Our study adds to the growing body of evidence supporting an effect of climate on predator-prey processes. Also, it identifies one possible mechanism involved in the relationship between solar irradiance and porcupine population cycles observed at this study site over a 130-year period.

AB The effect of foundation species on community assemblages in physically stressful environments has received much recent attention because of the importance of foundation species in ameliorating environmental stress. Many studies have described variable effects of foundation species on community diversity at small scales, but net positive effects over large scales. Egregia menziesii (Turner) J.E. Areschoug is a large and robust perennial kelp that creates a structurally complex habitat on rocky shores of the Northeast Pacific. This study investigated the effects of Egregia sporophytes on benthic assemblages of the rocky intertidal along the central California coast. Egregia sporophytes strongly impacted the structure of associated communities, due to wave-driven whiplash of fronds, shading, or habitat provision. A survey of Egregia populations at 10 stations along 200 km of the central California coast found effects of Egregia density on the intertidal to be consistent among sites. Increased Egregia sporophyte density negatively affected algal species richness, total algal cover, and cover of the most conspicuous species of algae. However, there was a positive relationship with algal crusts, geniculate coralline algae, and sessile invertebrates. Egregia removal experiments at two sites within the study area experimentally tested for the effects of Egregia on intertidal communities. Results from Soberanes Pt. were consistent with survey results because of the negative effect of Egregia on algal species diversity, subcanopy layering, and cover of abundant algal species. However, removal experiments at Pigeon Pt. resulted in a positive Egregia effect on algal diversity and cover of abundant algal species possibly due to lower Egregia densities, lower wave exposure than Soberanes Pt., and stress amelioration. In the lower energy environment, Egregia acted as a sand trap, yet sand accumulation did not negatively impact algal diversity. Negative effects of large brown algae on benthic assemblages have been observed in temperate waters around the world for certain intertidal or subtidal kelp in wave-swept environments allowing for scouring and substrate shading. This study shows that Egregia and morphologically similar brown algal species can have both negative and positive effects on community diversity depending on variation in density and local environmental conditions. Egregia has the opposite effect on community diversity than what has been previously reported for foundation species because it negatively affects biodiversity in stressful environments, but has a positive effect in less stressful environments.

AB A complex interaction between the sea urchin, Tripneustes ventricosus, and snail, Cerithium litteratum, has emerged in lagoonal backreefs of Jamaica. These two species are spatially correlated in most of the habitats that were examined. In field and laboratory observations, urchins pick up and cover their tests with as many as 40 live snails continuously for up to two days. I examined whether urchins cover to avoid predation, and whether growth and survival of snails is negatively affected by this behavior. The presence of predators prompted urchins to collect ten times as many snails, which gained 47% less tissue weight and 75% less shell lip thickness than snails unassociated with urchins. However, the survival rate of snails positioned on urchins was three times greater than that of free snails on sandy backreef substratum. Results of this study imply a biomass gain versus survival trade-off, and provide insights into complex interactions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Inducible defense, which is phenotypic plasticity in traits that affect predation risk, is taxonomically widespread and has been shown to have important ecological consequences. However, it remains unclear what factors promote the evolution of qualitatively different defense strategies and when evolution should favor strategies that involve modification of multiple traits. Previous theory suggests that individual-level trade-offs play a key role in defense evolution, but most of this work has assumed that trade-offs are independent. Here we show that the shape of the behavioral trade-off between foraging gain and predation risk determines the interaction between this trade-off and the life-history trade-off between growth and reproduction. The interaction between these fundamental trade-offs determines the optimal investment into behavioral and life-history defenses. Highly nonlinear foraging-predation risk trade-offs favor the evolution of behavioral defenses, while linear trade-offs favor life-history defenses. Between these extremes, integrated defense responses are optimal, with defense expression strongly depending on ontogeny. We suggest that these predictions may be general across qualitatively different defenses. Our results have important implications for theory on the ecological effects of inducible defense, which has not considered how qualitatively different defenses might alter ecological interactions.

AB Interactions between plants and herbivores are considered "diffuse" if the ecological interactions between two species, or their evolutionary responses, differ depending on the presence of a third species. I looked for evidence of diffuse interactions among horsenettle (Solanum carolinense) and two common herbivores. Plants experimentally protected from lace bugs (Gargaphia solani) were twice as susceptible to attack from flea beetles (Epitrix fuscula) once transplanted into the field. Thus, the selective benefit to horsenettle of resistance against lace bugs in nature would likely be diminished by increased attack from flea beetles. Moreover, the relative rank among horsenettle genotypes for resistance against flea beetles was changed by prior exposure to lace bugs. Thus, the genetic expression of resistance to flea beetles would depend on the "lace bug environment." By affecting selective pressures or response to selection, these sorts of diffuse interactions in a plant-herbivore community can slow the host plant's evolution of resistance to its herbivores.

AB Most wild animals show direct negative responses to human disturbance; however, disturbance may also have positive indirect effects by altering species interactions. In the Caribbean, introduced mongooses (Herpestes javanicus) are an important diurnal predator of the nests of critically endangered hawksbill sea turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata). We asked whether daytime visitor activity could benefit hawksbills by reducing mongoose activity in nesting habitat. We used track monitoring sites to measure how mongooses alter their space use in response to fluctuating human beach use and availability of hawksbill nests, and we estimated the indirect impact of human disturbance on nest predation for 5 years of hawksbill nesting. Human activity substantially decreased mongoose use of nesting habitat. Mongoose activity increased with abundance of nests and was lower at the edge than the interior of patches of beach vegetation, but neither factor altered relative sensitivity to disturbance. We estimated that, in addition to deterring mongooses from accessing nests on the open beach, human activity has the potential to reduce predation of nests in vegetation by up to 56% at our site, with the greatest per capita impact at low (<50) visitor numbers. Many forms of human activity negatively affect sea turtles, but our study indicates that there are positive aspects of daytime use of nesting beaches. Optimizing the trade-off between positive and negative impacts of disturbance could provide a useful approach for regulating tourist activity in critical habitat for threatened species.

AB The diversification of species and their interactions during the course of evolution has produced ecological networks with a complex topology. This topology influences the current functioning of ecosystems. It is therefore important to investigate whether the species introduced recently by human activities have merged seamlessly into recipient ecological networks by developing interactions quantitatively and qualitatively similar to those of native species, or whether their establishment has altered the topology of the networks. We tackled this issue in the case of a well resolved interaction network between 51 forest tree taxa and 154 pathogenic fungal species. We found that alien and native species with similar phylogenetic histories and life-history strategies had similar types and numbers of interactions. Our results also suggest that the clustered architecture of the network has not been altered by the integration of alien species. It therefore seems that a few centuries have been sufficient for the network to assimilate the newly introduced species. This rapid integration was unexpected for a plant-pathogen network, because selection acts continually on plants, favouring the emergence of defences against new pathogens and impeding the development of new interactions. However, it was recently shown that perturbation of the structure of ecological networks might be overlooked if species interactions are not quantified. The tree-parasitic fungus network considered in this study is binary. We might therefore end up with different results by using quantitative data.

AB One of the many ways that invasive species can affect native ecosystems is by modifying the behavioural and ecological interactions among native species. For example, the arrival of the highly toxic cane toad (Bufo marinus) in tropical Australia has induced toad-aversion in some native predators. Has that shift also affected the predators' responses to native prey-for example, by reducing vulnerability of native tadpoles via a mimicry effect, or increasing vulnerability of other prey types (such as insects) via a shift in predator feeding tactics? We exposed a native predator (northern trout gudgeon, Mogurnda mogurnda) to toad tadpoles in the laboratory, and measured effects of that exposure on the fish's subsequent intake of native tadpoles and crickets. As predicted, toad-exposed fishes reduced their rate of predation on (palatable) tadpoles of native frogs (Litoria caerulea and L. nasuta). If alternative prey (crickets) were available also, the toad-exposed fishes shifted even more strongly away from predation on native tadpoles. Thus, invasion of a toxic species can provide a mimicry benefit to native taxa that resemble the invader, and can shift predation pressure onto other taxa.

AB Aim
   To examine native-exotic species richness relationships across spatial scales and corresponding biotic homogenization in wetland plant communities.
   Location
   Illinois, USA.
   Methods
   We analysed the native-exotic species richness relationship for vascular plants at three spatial scales (small, 0.25 m2 of sample area; medium, 1 m2 of sample area; large, 5 m2 of sample area) in 103 wetlands across Illinois. At each scale, Spearman's correlation coefficient between native and exotic richness was calculated. We also investigated the potential for biotic homogenization by comparing all species surveyed in a wetland community (from the large sample area) with the species composition in all other wetlands using paired comparisons of their Jaccard's and Simpson's similarity indices.
   Results
   At large and medium scales, native richness was positively correlated with exotic richness, with the strength of the correlation decreasing from the large to the medium scale; at the smallest scale, the native-exotic richness correlation was negative. The average value for homogenization indices was 0.096 and 0.168, using Jaccard's and Simpson's indices, respectively, indicating that these wetland plant communities have been homogenized because of invasion by exotic species.
   Main Conclusions
   Our study demonstrated a clear shift from a positive to a negative native-exotic species richness relationship from larger to smaller spatial scales. The negative native-exotic richness relationship that we found is suggested to result from direct biotic interactions (competitive exclusion) between native and exotic species, whereas positive correlations likely reflect the more prominent influence of habitat heterogeneity on richness at larger scales. Our finding of homogenization at the community level extends conclusions from previous studies having found this pattern at much larger spatial scales. Furthermore, these results suggest that even while exhibiting a positive native-exotic richness relationship, community level biotas can/are still being homogenized because of exotic species invasion.

AB Aim
   To examine the role of multiple landscape factors on the species richness patterns of native and introduced freshwater fish.
   Location
   Mediterranean streams, south-western Iberian Peninsula, Europe (c. 87,000 km2).
   Methods
   We used a dataset of fish occurrences from 436 stream sites. We quantified the incremental explanatory power of multiple landscape factors in native, introduced, and overall local species richness using regression analysis. First, we related variation in local species richness across river basins to regional species richness (here, the basin species pool), area and factors of climate and topography. Second, we related within-river basin local species richness to site's climate and topography, and spatial structure derived from Principal Coordinates of Neighbour Matrices approach, after testing for species richness spatial autocorrelation; predicted local richness was mapped.
   Results
   Patterns of local species richness across river basins were strongly associated with regional species richness for overall, native and introduced species; annual rainfall showed a significant incremental contribution to variation in introduced species richness only. Within river basins, environmental factors were associated with local richness for the three species groups, though their contributions to the total explained variation were inferior to those of spatial factors; rainfall seasonality and stream slope were the most consistent environmental correlates for all species groups, while the influence of spatial factors was most prevalent for native species.
   Main conclusions
   Landscape factors operating among and within river basins seem to play a relevant role in shaping local species richness of both native and introduced species, and may be contingent on basin-specific contexts. Nevertheless, local factors, such as habitat characteristics and biotic interactions and human-induced disturbances may also be at play. Multiscale approaches incorporating a multitude of factors are strongly encouraged to facilitate a deeper understanding of the biodiversity patterns of Mediterranean streams, and to promote more effective conservation and management strategies.

AB Signals of species interactions can be inferred from survey data by asking if some species occur more or less often together than what would be expected by random, or more generally, if any structural aspect of the community deviates from that expected from a set of independent species. However, a positive (or negative) association between two species does not necessarily signify a direct or indirect interaction, as it can result simply from the species having similar (or dissimilar) habitat requirements. We show how these two factors can be separated by multivariate logistic regression, with the regression part accounting for species-specific habitat requirements, and a correlation matrix for the positive or negative residual associations. We parameterize the model using Bayesian inference with data on 22 species of wood-decaying fungi acquired in 14 dissimilar forest sites. Our analyses reveal that some of the species commonly found to occur together in the same logs are likely to do so merely by similar habitat requirements, whereas other species combinations are systematically either over-or underrepresented also or only after accounting for the habitat requirements. We use our results to derive hypotheses on species interactions that can be tested in future experimental work.

AB The geographic mosaic theory of coevolution states that variation in species interactions forms the raw material for coevolutionary processes, which take place over large geographic scales. One key assumption underlying the process of coevolution in plant-herbivore interactions is that herbivores exert selection on their host plants and that this selection varies among plant populations. We examined spatial variation in the existence and strength of phenotypic selection on host plant resistance exerted by specialist herbivores in 17 archipelago populations of the perennial herb Vincetoxicum hirundinaria (Asclepiadaceae). In these highly fragmented populations, V. hirundinaria is consumed by the larvae of two specialist herbivores: the folivorous moth Abrostola asclepiadis and the seed predator Euphranta connexa. Selection imposed on host plants by these herbivores was examined by analyzing the associations between levels of herbivory, plant fitness, and contents of a number of leaf chemicals reflecting plant resistance to and quality for the herbivores. We found extensive spatial variation in the levels of herbivory and in plant fitness. More importantly, the impact of both leaf herbivory and seed predation on plant fitness varied among plant populations, indicating spatial variation in phenotypic selection. In addition, leaf chemistry varied widely among plant populations, reflecting spatial variation in plant quality as food for the herbivores. However, leaf compounds influenced folivory similarly in all the studied plant populations, and interestingly, some of the compounds were associated with the intensity of seed predation. Finally, some of the leaf compounds were associated with plant fitness, and the strength and direction of these associations varied among plant populations. The observed spatial variation in the strength of the interactions between V. hirundinaria and its specialist herbivores suggests a geographic selection mosaic. Because the occurrence and strength of spatial variation varied between the two specialist herbivores, our results highlight the importance of considering multiple enemies when trying to understand evolution of interactions between plants and their herbivores.

AB Species interactions come in a variety of forms, from weak to strong, and negative or positive, each with unique consequences for local community structure. However, interactions depend on several biotic, abiotic and scale-dependent variables that make their magnitude and direction difficult to predict. Here, we quantify the relative impacts of multiple factors on species interactions for a diverse array of intertidal organisms, using our own experiments across a range of environments in New Zealand and North America. Interaction strengths are related to organism body size and trophic level, but are relatively insensitive to environmental conditions associated with tidal height. Although species at higher trophic levels exert stronger per-capita effects on other taxa, their population-level impacts are equivalent to basal trophic groups. This indicates that interaction intensity is largely based on requirements for resources, such as food or space, that follow allometric scaling rules. These results demonstrate the potential to predict interactivity based on simple criteria without detailed information on particular species or communities.

AB Rising atmospheric CO2 concentration will affect belowground processes and forest function. However, the direction and magnitude of change for many soil processes are unknown. We used minirhizotrons to observe fine root and fungal dynamics in response to elevated CO2 in a model regenerating longleaf pine community in open-top chambers. The model community consisted of five plant species common to xeric sandhills longleaf pine stands: Pinus palustris, Quercus margaretta, Aristida stricta, Crotalaria rotundifolia, and Asclepias tuberosa. Elevated CO2 significantly increased both fine root and mycorrhizal tip standing crop by more than 50% in the deeper soil horizon (17-34 cm). Rhizomorph standing crop was nearly doubled in both deep and shallow soil (P = 0.04). Survivorship results for fine roots and rhizomorphs varied between soil depths. Fine root survivorship was likely influenced more by changes in community composition and species interactions driven by elevated CO2 rather than by direct effects of elevated CO2 on the fine roots of individual species. In this system, it appears that elevated CO2 led to a greater reliance on fungal symbionts to meet additional nutrient requirements rather than substantially increased root growth.

AB P>1. Plant diversity has profound effects on primary production. Plant diversity has been shown to correlate with increased primary production in nutrient-limited grassland ecosystems. This overyielding has been attributed to vertical niche differentiation among species below-ground, allowing for complementarity in resource capture. However, a rigorous test of this longstanding hypothesis is lacking because roots of different species could not be distinguished in diverse communities.
   2. Here, we present the first application of a DNA-based technique that quantifies species abundances in multispecies root samples. We were thus able to compare root distributions in monocultures of two grasses and two forbs with root distributions in four-species mixtures. In order to investigate if vertical niche differentiation is driven by soil nutrient depletion, the topsoil layer of the communities were either nutrient-rich or -poor.
   3. Immediately in the first year, 40% more root biomass was produced in mixtures than expected from the monocultures, together with significant below-ground complementarity effects, probably preceding above-ground overyielding. This below-ground overyielding appeared not to be the result of vertical niche differentiation, as rooting depth of the community tended to decrease, rather than increase in mixtures compared to monocultures. Roots thus tended to clump in the very dense topsoil layer rather than segregate over the whole profile in mixtures. The below-ground overyielding was mainly driven by enhanced root investments of one species, Anthoxanthum odoratum, in the densely rooted topsoil layer without retarding the growth of the other species.
   4. Synthesis. Conventional ecological mechanisms, such as competition for nutrients, do not seem to be able to explain the increased root investments of A. odoratum in mixtures compared to monocultures, with apparently little effect on the root growth of the other species. Instead, the observed root responses are consistent with species-specific root recognition responses. From a community perspective, the observed early below-ground overyielding may initiate the recently reported increased soil organic matter, mineralization and N availability and thus may ultimately be responsible for the higher productivity at high plant species diversity.

AB P>1. It is not clear how local and regional processes influence plant species recruitment. Local abiotic factors are predicted to constrain recruitment under harsh environmental conditions and low productivity, whereas the role of seed availability may be more important at intermediate productivity. The role of establishment limitation (local interactions) is predicted to increase under high productivity due to competition.
   2. This study examined the effects of local biotic interactions, such as competition and facilitation from the resident vegetation, on alpine plant species recruitment, and investigated whether the role of species interactions depended on productivity. All naturally emerging seedlings were recorded in plots with intact vegetation and where vegetation had been removed, in a natural low-productivity alpine Dryas heath and in plots where productivity had increased after fertilizing.
   3. Positive effects of vegetation removal on seedling emergence suggested that competition from neighbour vegetation may have an important role for recruitment in alpine plant communities. The role of competitive release increased with productivity. Productivity increased short-term, but not long-term seedling recruitment, likely due to increased competition from re-growth over time. There was no effect of productivity on species richness recovery after vegetation removal.
   4. There was a positive relationship between neighbour species richness and seedling density in the low-productivity plots, but not in the high-productivity plots. Local seed production was the major seed source in both parts of the heath, but in the high-productivity plots, the high abundance of a few species in the species pool was more important for seedling recruitment than species richness.
   5. Synthesis. Competition may play a significant role for plant species recruitment in environmentally harsh habitats of low productivity, where abiotic factors or facilitation traditionally are predicted to be more important ecological filters. Climate warming and increased nitrogen deposition may result in higher productivity of tundra plant communities, which may increase the role of competition, and the identity of neighbour species may become more important for recruitment than species richness.

TI Resource allocation to defence and growth are driven by different
   responses to generalist and specialist herbivory in an invasive plant

AB P>1. Invasive plants often have novel biotic interactions in their introduced ranges. These interactions, including less frequent herbivore attacks, may convey a competitive advantage over native plants. Invasive plants may vary in defence strategies (resistance vs. tolerance) or in response to the type of herbivore (generalists vs. specialists), but no study to date has examined this broad set of traits simultaneously.
   2. Here, we examined resistance and tolerance of Chinese tallow (Triadica sebifera) populations from the introduced and native ranges to generalist (Cnidocampa flavescens) and specialist herbivores (Gadirtha inexacta) in the native range.
   3. In a field common-garden test of resistance, caterpillars of each species were raised on plants from native and invasive populations. We found the specialist grew larger on and consumed more mass of invasive plant populations than native populations, while the generalist showed the same performance between them. The results were consistent with our laboratory bioassay using excised leaves. Chemical analyses showed that the invasive plants had lower tannin content and higher ratio of carbohydrate to protein than those of their native counterparts, suggesting that plants from invasive populations have altered chemistry that has a larger impact on specialist than on generalist resistance.
   4. To test for differences in herbivore tolerance, plants were first defoliated by specialist or generalist herbivory and then allowed to regrow for 100 days in a field common garden. We found that plants from invasive populations had greater herbivore tolerance than native populations, especially for tolerance to generalists. They also grew more rapidly than native counterparts in the absence of herbivory.
   5. Synthesis. The results of these experiments indicate that differences in selective pressures between ranges have caused dramatic reductions in resistance to specialist herbivores and those changes in plant secondary chemistry likely underlie these differences. The greater tolerance of invasive populations to herbivory appears to at least partly reflect an increase in growth rate in the introduced range. The greater tolerance to generalist herbivores suggests the intriguing possibility of selection for traits that allow plants to tolerate generalist herbivores more than specialist herbivores.

AB P>1. Whereas classic niche theory is based on the contraction of the niche via negative interactions, facilitative niche theory suggests that mutualisms can expand the niche via positive interactions. Specifically, animal-mediated seed dispersal can expand the utilization of physical space by plants and allow greater access to resources and other environmental requirements. Ant-mediated dispersal of plant propagules (myrmecochory) is a common mutualism throughout the world, particularly in the deciduous forests of the eastern United States where this research is conducted.
   2. We examine two facets of niche expansion via ant-mediated seed dispersal: (1) increased utilization of resources along resource gradients and (2) escape from unfavourable density-dependent conditions.
   3. We test these assumptions by introducing Hexastylis arifolia seeds in cafeteria-style bait stations along abiotic gradients (moisture, temperature, light) for removal by key seed dispersers from the ant genus Aphaenogaster. We also examine plant aggregation along the same gradients.
   4. Ant-mediated dispersal services decrease significantly with increasing soil moisture and ultimately fail at levels that are demonstratively within the plant's niche optima; further, the decline in dispersal services is correlated with increasing plant aggregation, suggesting that enemy escape also falters at relatively high levels of soil moisture.
   5. Synthesis. Facilitated propagule dispersal fails to expand the Hexastylis arifolia niche in either enhanced resource utilization or decreased density dependence as the niche requirements for the ant disperser are nested within those for the plant. The strength of this interaction varies across space and time, and in doing so may undermine attempts to predict future distributions. Further, given that myrmecochores are typically poor dispersers, the incomplete niche overlap between the plant and its facilitator makes this plant guild particularly susceptible to climatic change if each participant responds individually to shifting environmental conditions.

AB Aims
   Evaluation of the interaction intensity between Masson pine (Pinus massoniana) and broadleaved trees will facilitate selecting tree combinations suitable for reforestation in abandoned sites in subtropical areas.
   Methods
   Pinus massoniana and seven broadleaved trees species were grown either in monoculture or in two-species mixture. Biomass of tree species was measured and inter-specific interactions were estimated using log response ratio. Test of homogeneity of variances was performed to compare the stability of biomass in the monoculture of the broadleaved trees with that in the mixture.
   Important Findings
   Our results showed that the direction and intensity of interactions between P. massoniana and the broadleaved trees varied from year to year and the identity of the broadleaved species. Facilitative interactions were found between Camellia oleifera, Rhus chinensis and P. massoniana. Pinus massoniana had competitive effects on Lithocarpus glaber, Cyclobalanopsis glauca and Elaeocarpus japonicus. Significantly negative relations were found between biomass of P. massoniana and the broadleaved trees in the third year of the experiment, and the compensatory effects between P. massoniana and the broadleaved trees may be involved in stability maintenance in the multi-species forests in the subtropical area. The results of homogeneity test of variances also showed that the biomass per pot in the mixture had significantly lower variances than that in the monoculture, suggesting that total biomass is more stable in the mixture than the monoculture.

AB Geographic variation in species interactions can have major effects on species distributions and can be important for the resistance of resident communities to invasive species. We tested the hypothesis that coexistence or replacement of a resident North American mosquito Aedes aegypti with the invasive Aedes albopictus is affected by interpopulation variation in the inherent competitive ability of A. aegypti and variation in the fecundity-size relationship. We postulated that such variation creates differential population-level outcomes of competition with A. albopictus. We compared competitive abilities of eight North American populations of A. aegypti, four populations sympatric to A. albopictus, and four populations allopatric to A. albopictus. Competition among larvae from each A. aegypti population and a single A. albopictus population was tested in laboratory microcosms in a response-surface design. We found origin of A. aegypti influences its competitive response to competition from A. albopictus and competitive effect on A. albopictus. A. aegypti from allopatric sites preformed better in competition with A. albopictus than did A. aegypti from sympatric sites because they had a stronger average effect on A. albopictus. This average was strongly influenced by the allopatric population from Miami. Competitive effect and response were uncorrelated among populations, indicating inconsistent ranking of A. aegypti in competitive effect and response. Although A. albopictus is generally a superior competitor to A. aegypti, a stronger competitive effect of particular A. aegypti populations on invading A. albopictus may contribute to competition-mediated biotic resistance to the invader. These results suggest that interpopulation variation in competitive ability of A. aegypti may contribute to failure of A. albopictus to invade parts of the southeastern United States and offer evidence of a contribution to biotic resistance by an inferior competitor. Geographic variation in competitive ability may be common and one general cause of variation in invasion success and impact.

TI Cascading trait-mediation: disruption of a trait-mediated mutualism by

AB Trait-mediated indirect interactions (TMII) are important driving-forces causing trophic cascades in aquatic and terrestrial food webs. Furthermore, since most biological communities are not simple food chains but complex networks of interactions, one TMII within a community might easily be influenced by another TMII. In other words, TMII themselves can be cascades with potential implications for community dynamics. Here we report on one of such cascade, where a parasitic fly induces behavioral changes that disrupt a trait-mediated ant-hemipteran mutualism. We show that during parasite-induced low-activity periods, the ant Azteca instabilis fails to protect its mutualistic scale-insect partner against predatory ladybeetles. Thus, in the presence of the parasite, ladybeetles ate as many scales in ant-patrolled plants as they did in ant-free plants. These results demonstrate how, through a cascade of trait-mediated interactions, associations between members of a community can be drastically altered.

TI Variation on a theme of herbivory: Corallina-hermit crab relationship on
   a temperate-subtropical rocky shore

AB Elucidation of species interactions involving multiple processes is an important task in ecology, as different processes may operate in non-apparent, opposing directions. While herbivory is a major form of interspecific interaction affecting plants, calcareous algae are generally thought to be protected from herbivory due to CaCO(3) deposition. However, field observations and experiments in temperate-subtropical intertidal rockpools showed that hermit crabs (Paguroidea, Decapoda) did not ingest Corallina but cut short its fronds. We tested the implications of this frond-cutting behaviour with field experiments where hermit crab density and Corallina frond length were artificially manipulated.
   Hermit crab guts were fuller and contained more microscopic animals when Corallina fronds were shorter, suggesting that frond-cutting affects accessibility to food resources that exist in the basal part of algal mat. Corallina showed compensatory growth when fronds were artificially reduced in length/density, simulating the cutting by hermit crabs. Frond density increased, probably due to increased exposure to light of the basal part of Corallina coupled with a reduction in apical dominance.
   The present study revealed a direct, non-trophic relationship between hermit crabs and Corallina in which the former affected the latter for gaining access to food resources. Overall, the combination of positive and negative effects of hermit crab led to a positive, facilitative effect on Corallina. In terms of the effect on algae or plants, this relationship is functionally analogous to herbivory, without involving direct consumption. We discuss the problem of extending the concept of ecological engineering to herbivory and herbivory-like phenomena and suggest the term 'pseudo-herbivory' to describe relations in which animals have non-trophic but herbivory-like effects on plants/algae, as seen in the hermit crab-Corallina relationship.

AB Spatial dispersal pattern could determine the spatial pattern of establishment affecting the vegetation structure. Our work, analyze dispersion and colonization attribute of the hemiparasitic plant Misodendrum punctulatum (Misodendraceae). Our hypothesis outline that the wind dispersal pattern of M. punctulatum seeds determine the infection pattern (colonization) on Nothofagus antarctica, and both processes (dispersion and colonization) are asymmetric in accordance with the predominant wind direction. This study was carry out in a N. antarctica (host) post-fire shrubland. We assessed the seed dispersal estimating number of seed on host branches supplied from infected-survivals hosts (focal host) toward each cardinal direction. Colonization was assessed estimating number of infections on each host, through transects, at every cardinal direction from the focal host. We observed that seeds dispersed decline with distances from the seed source, and dispersion fitted to a negative exponential model. The longest distance of primary dispersion observed was 10 m toward east. About colonization, longest distance from the focal host was 22.5 m toward south. Furthermore, ratio of infected host was lesser on west, one infected by 10 uninfected (1:10) than other compass aspects (1:6). Both process, dispersion and colonization, showed a similar and asymmetric pattern of distribution, which could be result of wind direction predominant from northwest. In addition, a high spatial correlation was observed among number of seed dispersed and recruitment of infection in distances from the sources of seeds. Our results allow understand the patterns of spatial distribution and infection dynamics of Misodendrum punctulatum. In order to plan management strategies, understanding the infection dynamics is useful to perform successfully strategies to the control of hemiparasitic plants in forest to commercial use, and conservation or restoration strategies, e.g. to restorate this hemiparasitic specie in areas recently colonized by N. antarctica. These studied aspects in Misodendrum punctulatum contribute to the knowledge of this ecological interaction, which is frequent in Nothofagus forests from Argentina and Chile.

AB Recruitment patterns of coastal species with complex life cycles are heavily influenced by physical variability in the coastal ocean. Spatial and temporal patterns of variability in rates of larval settlement may provide clues as to the processes that drive their transport and onshore delivery, as well as variation in the supply side of population dynamics. Over 3 consecutive seasons (2006-2008), the settlement of three intertidal barnacles (the chthamaloids Jehlius cirratus and Notochthamalus scabrosus, and the balanoid Notobalanus flosculus) was monitored daily at 5 to 6 sites spread over ca. 10 km around the bay of Cartagena in central Chile, and over periods of 48,71 and 53 consecutive days that encompassed the settlement season of these species. This sampling effort yielded settlement data with an unprecedented combination of temporal resolution and spatial coverage, which allowed us to assess and compare: (1) spatial patterns of settlement and their persistence over scales of days within each season, (2) inter-annual variation in pattern persistence, and (3) the relationship between such variation and inter-annual changes in spatial patterns of sea surface temperature (SST) variability over synoptic and high-frequency scales. While on average the spatial pattern of settlement in chthamaloids became less persistent from 2006 to 2008, the settlement pattern of N. flosculus across sites remained persistent regardless of inter-annual changes in mean settlement rates. Within seasons, the spatial patterns of settlement of N. flosculus were persistent over scales of at least 15 days, whereas for chthamaloids a spatially ordered pattern of settlement in 2006 disappeared in subsequent years. Together, these results suggest that spatially structured processes that drive larval transport, and which can vary from year to year, may have played a greater role in shaping settlement patterns of chthamaloids versus balanoids. Synoptic-scale SST variability (i.e. days) exhibited spatial structure that was highly persistent within all three seasons. Although high-frequency SST variability (i.e. hours) has been associated to onshore larval transport within the study region, its among-site patterns were not as persistent as the daily ones. Since neither synoptic-scale nor high-frequency processes shaping patterns of physical variability are sufficient to explain inter-annual variability in patterns of larval settlement, more complex physical-biological interactions must be examined. We suggest that inter-annual changes in the pattern of wind forcing relative to local topography, and the thermal structure that results from such interaction, might be related to whether the spatial structure of barnacle settlement is persistent or fluctuating within a given season. We discuss the limitations of inferences that can be made regarding transport processes from time series of larval settlement, and the insights that can be gained by focusing on the variability of spatial patterns rather than temporal changes at individual sites.

AB The supply of new recruits can be a critical determinant of community structure, but estimating recruitment density can be challenging due to variation in larval supply, settlement, substratum, species interactions and physical stresses. We evaluated the effect of surface type and limpet "bulldozing" on settlement and recruitment of barnacles, using replicated field experiments sampled monthly at each of four sites along the central Oregon coast in 2001, 2003, and 2008. A particular goal was to evaluate the efficacy of Saf-T-Walk, a widely used textured surface, in quantifying actual patterns and levels of recruitment. In 2001 and 2003 experiments, surfaces were bare rock (ROCK) and Saf-T-Walk (MA). In 2008 experiments, to further evaluate the influence of surface rugosity, we added two additional artificial substratum types - smooth PVC plates (no texture) and travertine plates (TRAV, low texture). Limpet activity was manipulated using barriers of anti-fouling paint. Results indicated the overwhelming importance of surface texture. Recruitment density was highest in 2001, lower in 2003, and lowest in 2008. Recruitment on STW, the most textured surface, ranged up to 87 times greater than on ROCK, and the rank order of surfaces for recruitment density was STW>ROCK>TRAV>PVC which matches that for texture. Settlement differences were even greater, with up to 1180-fold higher settlement on STW than ROCK. Limpets usually had a negative effect on recruitment of Balanus glandula on ROCK, likely due to bulldozing and direct consumption, but had a positive effect on STW. These impacts were reduced or negated when recruitment density was higher (e.g., 2001) or lower than average (e.g., 2008). Limpets had no consistent effect on Chthamalus dalli. Abundances of settlers and recruits on the different surfaces were positively correlated (explaining up to 71% of the variance), and correlations between STW and other surfaces generally were stronger in the absence of limpets. Although compared to bare rock, recruitment to STW overestimates absolute rates of recruitment, use of STW settlement plates provides an effective and relatively efficient means of determining spatial and temporal patterns of recruitment at local to geographic scales.

AB Dispersal is a central process determining community structure in heterogeneous landscapes, and species interactions within habitats may be a major determinant of dispersal. Although the effects of species interactions on dispersal within habitats have been well studied, how species interactions affect the movement of individuals between habitats in a landscape has received less attention. We conducted two experiments to assess the extent to which predation risk affects dispersal from an aquatic habitat by a flight-capable semi-aquatic insect (Notonecta undulata). Exposure to non-lethal (caged) fish fed conspecifics increased dispersal rates in N. undulata. Moreover, dispersal rate was positively correlated with the level of risk imposed by the fish; the greater the number of notonectids consumed by the caged fish, the greater the dispersal rate from the habitat. These results suggest that risk within a habitat can affect dispersal among habitats in a landscape and thus affect community structure on a much greater scale than the direct effect of predation itself.

AB By ameliorating environmental conditions, mediating species interactions and regulating resource availability in ecosystems, habitat-forming, foundation species underlie the structure and function of many ecological communities. Current and predicted human-induced changes to ecosystems require a mechanistic understanding of how foundation species enable the persistence of diverse, functioning ecological communities. By manipulating the abundance of a putative foundation species of rocky intertidal tidepool communities, the seagrass Phyllospadix spp. (surfgrass), this study assesses how surfgrass affects the thermal environment and structure of tidepool communities over a period of two years. Surfgrass removal pools experienced temperatures up to 10 degrees C higher than control pools during low tide. Changes in community composition of sessile organism accompanied this change in thermal regime. Over two years, removal pools saw a significant decline in the abundance of coralline crusts and bare space and an increase in the abundance of foliose red algae while control pool communities remained stable. At the level of functional groups, community similarity metrics showed pool communities became more variable in space in response to surfgrass removal, demonstrating that pool communities diverge dramatically in the absence of surfgrass. In removal pools, recovery of surfgrass was limited with less than 25% of pre-removal abundance after two years. However, removal pool communities shifted toward species compositions that favor surfgrass recruitment and suggest a mechanism by which surfgrass recovery may be enhanced over the long-term. Surfgrass clearly play a foundational role in tidepools by reducing pool temperatures and act to stabilize tidepool communities. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB During their transition from the pelagic larval form to the benthic adult form, larvae are likely to encounter a diverse assemblage of resident invertebrates on oyster reefs. Fouling epifauna are generally believed to reduce the settlement of interspecific larvae through competitive exclusion and predation. Studies of these interactions, however, often utilize artificial settlement panels, which can exhibit different recruitment patterns to those observed on natural substrates.
   Native (Crassostrea virginica) and non-native (Crassostrea ariakensis) oyster larvae were exposed to reef-collected shells, each supporting a single species of reef-associated fauna, over a series of laboratory microcosm studies. The presence of adult bryozoans (Membranipora tenuis) had little effect on rates of larval settlement or mortality. The boring sponge (Cliona sp.) significantly decreased oyster larval settlement, and generally increased oyster mortality. Barnacles (Balanus improvisus) typically facilitated settlement. Barnacle molds and empty barnacle tests, intended to mimic the surface area and rugosity of live barnacles, did not significantly affect settlement. In some trials, adult barnacle bathwater enhanced settlement of oyster larvae, highlighting the importance of waterborne cues. Barnacle bathwaters, adult clam worm (Neanthes succinea) bathwaters and bathwaters created using adult oysters were all found to cause oyster larval mortality. Predation by clam worms, which were observed at very high densities on field-collected oyster shells, caused significant oyster larval mortality in these experiments.
   The combined effects of positive and negative interactions between oyster larvae and resident invertebrate reef fauna require enumeration under field conditions. The results from this study highlight the need for a more thorough understanding of settlement behavior and mortality sources of recruiting oyster larvae. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Spatial segregation is one of the common mechanisms allowing the co-existence of similar interacting species in heterogeneous environments. Analysing spatial segregation requires information on individual home-range sizes and their degree of spatial overlap. In this study, we used radio-tracking to report for the first time the home-range and core-area sizes of sympatric Cabrera and water voles and to analyse intra- and inter-specific space sharing within habitat patches in a highly fragmented landscape. Results indicated that both species exhibited strong fine-scale site fidelity and reduced variation in range size across sexes and seasons. Monogamous mating system seemed to prevail for both species, although water voles may also exhibit polygynous breeding strategies. Mean home-range and core-area sizes of water voles (946.3 and 156.6 m(2)) were about twice that of Cabrera voles (418.2 and 55.1 m(2)). Within habitat patches, individuals of both species often overlapped their home ranges, particularly during the dry season (May-September), though intra-specific home-range overlap was generally higher than inter-specific overlap. Inter-specific space sharing was restricted to areas outside the centre of activity of animals, as no core-area overlap was ever recorded between Cabrera and water voles. Taken together, results support the view that co-existence of Cabrera and water voles in Mediterranean patchy habitats may in part result from spatial segregation among individuals, which may reflect competitive displacement or small-scale habitat partitioning. Results highlight the need to account for species interactions when designing conservation management strategies for sympatric Cabrera and water voles in fragmented landscapes.

AB Invasions have often been linked to reduced biodiversity, but the role of non-native species in the decline of native species is ambiguous. In a 2003 survey of four California vineyard regions, exotic spiders (Cheiracanthium spp.) were more dominant in vineyards with lower spider species diversity and reduced spider abundance. There was no evidence for the role of species interactions in the invasion of Cheiracanthium spiders, however, as native spiders from the same feeding guild were most abundant in regions with high Cheiracanthium levels. Comparison with a survey conducted 10 years earlier indicated that the recent invader C. mildei simply represented an addition to the spider community, with no apparent change in proportions of the congener C. inclusum. Invasion success is discussed with respect to agricultural habitat, as results suggest that disturbed conditions in many vineyards may favor Cheiracanthium spp. and native wandering spiders while decreasing overall spider diversity.

AB The complexity of food webs poses a significant hurdle for our growing understanding of the structure and dynamics of ecological communities. Empirical methods that measure the per capita strengths of trophic species interactions offer a means to identify keystone species and bridge mathematical models and data to synthesize our knowledge of population dynamics and predator feeding behaviors. Many such methods have been proposed, but few have seen independent validation of their estimates or underlying assumptions. This is particularly so with respect to the nonlinear functional responses by which predators often respond to their prey. Here I describe an empirical test of a recently proposed observational method for estimating the nonlinear strength of predator-prey interactions in the field. By applying the method to two populations of a predatory intertidal whelk, Haustrum scobina, I estimated its per capita attack rates on all nine of its observed prey species. These spanned two orders of magnitude in per capita strength. Concurrent experimental manipulations of the two predator populations provided population time series for the response of a mussel prey species, Xenostrobus pulex. I obtained independent interaction strength estimates for this focal interaction by fitting a sequence of hypothesized predator-prey models to these time series. Overall, site-specific models assuming linear functional responses performed better than all others. A direct comparison of the attack-rate estimates from the observational method with those of the best-performing nonlinear model nevertheless revealed high concordance between the two methods. The results of this study therefore support the use of the observational method in larger and more complex food webs and suggest that trophic interactions in the range of mean prey densities observed in nature are approximately linear.

AB P>Adaptive variation in the traits determining ecological interactions can lead to evolution so rapid that ecological dynamics change course while in progress (i.e., 'eco-evolutionary dynamics'). However, little is known about how the qualitative properties of eco-evolutionary dynamics (e.g., cycling, equilibrium, etc.) are affected by the amount of heritable variation present. Here, we show that a change in the range of variation in a heritable prey defense trait determines what dynamics are observed in an experimental predator-prey system. We combine modelling and laboratory experiments to show that initial defense trait variation determines whether populations exhibit eco-evolutionary cycles in which heritable variation is maintained, or converge to an equilibrium at which the prey population becomes monomorphic. Our results show how small changes in the amount of adaptive genetic variance initially present can radically alter eco-evolutionary dynamics, and can ultimately determine whether heritable variation is maintained or lost.

AB The object of this study was to provide the first data on the natural history of the little known plant-florivore interaction between Opuntia microdasys and Olycella aff. junctolineella larvae and to study interindividual variability in the number of reproductive structures attacked as a function of plant resource availability
   Field observations of larval activity and a quantification of the damages produced were done at the Southern Chihuahuan Desert, Mexico To quantify the interindividual variation of florivory damage as a function of resource availability (water and nutrients), a resource addition experiment was carried out.
   Larvae caused 21% of buds and 7% of flowers to abort Adding resources (water and nutrients) to plants had no effect on bud production, although more buds developed into flowers and fruits in fertilized plants, suggesting a selective abortion against ill-nourished reproductive structures The number of buds and flowers attacked by larvae were higher for non-fertilized than for fertilized plants, indicating that reproductive structures of plants under abiotic stress become more suitable as food for florivores The number of structures attacked was a non-linear function of the number of buds originally produced, suggesting a florivore satiation threshold.

AB Questions
   Do spatial and temporal patterns of encroachment of Pinus contorta and Abies grandis in a montane meadow suggest strong biotic controls on the invasion process?
   Location
   Forest-meadow mosaic, 1350 m a.s.l., Cascade Range, Oregon, US.
   Methods
   We combined spatial point pattern analysis, population age structures, and a time-series of stem maps to quantify spatial and temporal patterns of conifer invasion over a 200-yr period in three plots totaling 4 ha.
   Results
   Trees established during two broad, but distinct periods (late 1800s, then at much greater density in the mid-1900s). Recent invasion was not correlated with climatic variation. Abies grandis dominated both periods; P. contorta established at lower density, peaking before A. grandis. Spatially, older (>= 90 yr) P. contorta were randomly distributed, but older A. grandis were strongly clumped (0.2-20 m). Younger (< 90 yr) stems were positively associated at small distances (both within and between species), but were spatially displaced from older A. grandis, suggesting a temporal shift from facilitation to competition. Establishment during the 1800s resulted in widely scattered P. contorta and clumps of A. grandis that placed most areas of meadow close to seed sources permitting more rapid invasion during the mid-1900s. Rapid conversion to forest occurred via colonization of larger meadow openings - first by shade-intolerant P. contorta, then by shade-tolerant A. grandis - and by direct infilling of smaller openings by A. grandis.
   Conclusions
   In combination, spatial and temporal patterns of establishment suggest an invasion process shaped by biotic interactions, with facilitation promoting expansion of trees into meadows and competition influencing subsequent forest development. Once invasion is initiated, tree species with different life histories and functional traits can interact synergistically to promote rapid conversion of meadow to forest under a broad range of climatic conditions.

AB Question
   How does an improved understanding of species interactions, combined with an additional ecological variable (wind speed), alter the projected vegetation response to variation in altitudinal temperature?
   Location
   Cairngorm Mountains, Scotland.
   Methods
   Montane heathland vegetation was sampled from 144 plots (432 quadrats) comprising eight altitudinal transects. Ordination by partial DCA and path analysis was used to confirm: (1) the effect of wind speed and altitude (approximate to temperature) on vegetation structure, i.e. canopy height and cover of bare ground, and (2) the control of arctic/alpine macrolichen occurrence by vegetation structure. Nested regression analysis was used to project the response of vegetation structure and lichen occurrence to temperature change scenarios with and without a step-wise change in future wind speed.
   Results
   Warming trends shifted vegetation zones upwards, with a subsequent loss of suitable habitat for arctic/alpine lichens. However, incorporating wind speed as an additional explanatory variable had an important modifying effect on the vegetation response to temperature: decreasing wind speed exaggerates the effects of increased temperature and vice versa. Our models suggest that for the wind-driven heath examined, a 20% increase in mean wind speed may negate the effect of increased temperature on vegetation structure, resulting in no net change in lichen occurrence.
   Conclusions
   We caution that an improved understanding of species interactions in vegetation response models may force the consideration of locally variable environmental parameters (e.g. wind speed), bringing into question the predicted vegetation response based on standard projections of temperature change along altitudinal gradients.

AB Although malaria parasites infecting non-human primates are important models for human malaria, little is known of the ecology of infection by these parasites in the wild. We extensively sequenced cytochrome b (cytb) of malaria parasites (Apicomplexa: Haemosporida) from free-living southeast Asian monkeys Macaca nemestrina and Macaca fascicularis. The two most commonly observed taxa were Plasmodium inui and Hepatocystis sp., but certain other sequences did not cluster closely with any previously sequenced species. Most of the major clades of parasites were found in both Macaca species, and the two most commonly occurring parasite infected the two Macaca species at approximately equal levels. However, P. inui showed evidence of genetic differentiation between the populations infecting the two Macaca species, suggesting limited movement of this parasite among hosts. Moreover, coinfection with Plasmodium and Hepatocystis species occurred significantly less frequently than expected on the basis of the rates of infection with either taxon alone, suggesting the possibility of competitive exclusion. The results revealed unexpectedly complex communities of Plasmodium and Hepatocystis taxa infecting wild southeast Asian monkeys. Parasite taxa differed with respect to both the frequency of between-host movement and their frequency of coinfection.

AB Activation of the immune system in insects has been shown to be costly in the laboratory setting, but experimental studies in the field are lacking. The costs of immunity in the wild may be different to those in the laboratory because animals in the wild are simultaneously subjected to a suite of selective agents. We have measured the costs of immune system activation in a wild population of the territorial damselfly Calopteryx splendens. Immune-challenged males were found to be less likely to be territorial and had lower overall survival rates than control or sham-manipulated males. Because territorial males have a higher mating success than nonterritorial males, this result suggests that immune-challenged males are also likely to suffer reduced mating success. However, the activation of the immune system as such did not increase predation risk; this occurred due to a combination of the former with a reduced territory-holding potential. As such, immune-challenged males not holding a territory were most susceptible to predation by birds. The size of the wing spots, a known sexually selected male trait, predicted territorial behaviour in control and sham-manipulated males, but not in immune-challenged males. Our data show that immune system activation can have several costs acting in unison and that ubiquitous ecological interactions, such as predation, may affect trade-offs between immunity and other life history traits.

AB Three mineral soil and four ornithogenic soil sites were sampled during summer 2006 at Cierva Point (Antarctic Peninsula) to study their bacterial, microalgal and faunal communities in relation to abiotic and biotic features.
   Soil moisture, pH, conductivity, organic matter and nutrient contents were consistently lower and more homogeneous in mineral soils. Ornithogenic soils supported larger and more variable bacterial abundances than mineral ones. Algal communities from mineral soils were more diverse than those from ornithogenic soils, although chlorophyll-a concentrations were significantly higher in the latter. This parameter and bacterial abundance were correlated with nutrient and organic matter contents. The meiofauna obtained from mineral soils was homogeneous, with one nematode species dominating all samples. The fauna of ornithogenic soils varied widely in composition and abundance. Tardigrades and rotifers dominated the meiofauna at eutrophic O2, where they supported a large population of the predatory nematode Coomansus gerlachei. At site O3, high bacterial abundance was consistent with high densities of the bacterivorous nematodes Plectus spp.
   This study provides evidence that Antarctic soils are complex and diverse systems, and suggests that biotic interactions (e.g. competition and predation) may have a stronger and more direct influence on community variability in space and time than previously thought.

AB Good decision making for fisheries and marine ecosystems requires a capacity to anticipate the consequences of management under different scenarios of climate change. The necessary ecological forecasting calls for ecosystem-based models capable of integrating multiple drivers across trophic levels and properly including uncertainty. The methodology presented here assesses the combined impacts of climate and fishing on marine food-web dynamics and provides estimates of the confidence envelope of the forecasts. It is applied to cod (Gadus morhua) in the Baltic Sea, which is vulnerable to climate-related decline in salinity owing to both direct and indirect effects (i.e. through species interactions) on early-life survival. A stochastic food web-model driven by regional climate scenarios is used to produce quantitative forecasts of cod dynamics in the twenty-first century. The forecasts show how exploitation would have to be adjusted in order to achieve sustainable management under different climate scenarios.

AB The outcome of competitive interactions is likely to be influenced by both competitive dominance (i.e. niche-based dynamics) and ecological drift (i.e. neutral dynamics governed by demographic stochasticity). However, spatial models of competition rarely consider the joint operation of these two processes. We develop a model based on the original competition-colonization trade-off model that incorporates niche and neutral processes and several realistic facets of ecological dynamics: it allows local competition (i.e. competition within a patch) to occur within communities of a finite size, it allows competitors to vary in the degree of competitive asymmetry, and it includes the role of local migration (i.e. propagule pressure). The model highlights the role of community size, i.e. the number of competitors in the local community, in mediating the relative importance of stochastic and deterministic forces. In metacommunities where local communities are small, ecological drift is substantial enough that strong competitors become effectively neutral, creating abrupt changes in the outcome of competition not predicted by the standard competition-colonization trade-off. Importantly, the model illustrates that, even when other aspects of species interactions (e. g. migration ability, competitive ability) are unchanged, local community size can alter the dynamics of metacommunity persistence. Our work demonstrates that activities which reduce the size of local communities, such as habitat destruction and degradation, effectively compound the extinction debt.

AB Local habitat structure and resource availability appear to be of great importance for the diversity, abundance, and community structure of bees. We examined the contribution of three different habitat types (farmland, forest edge, forest understory) to bee diversity in a tropical forest-agriculture mosaic in Western Kenya and analysed differences and overlap in plant-bee community interactions between nearby habitats. We used network properties (network size and specialization indices) and bee species turnover to examine temporal and spatial variation of flower-visitation interaction networks in general and in bee species composition in detail across habitats. In total we found 121 bee and 89 plant species involved in the interactions. Results suggest that bees were limited by floral resources because the largest networks, highest diversity, and largest abundances were found at the forest edge and in the farmland which hosted higher amounts of flowers and a more homogeneous distribution of resources in space and time. Forest in the study area is characterized by (1) lower flower density and (2) more humid conditions relative to the farmland. We therefore suggest that the species-rich and structurally diverse farmland acts as a "pollinator rescue" which supports bee communities in the natural forest. We advise conservation managers and politicians to conserve the structural richness of the farmland to (1) preserve bee diversity within the farmland and (2) conserve positive effects of the farmland on bee activity in the forest remnant.

AB Mixed-species tree plantations, composed of high-value native rain forest timbers, are potential forestry systems for the subtropics and tropics that can provide ecological and production benefits. Choices of rain forest tree species for mixtures are generally based on the concept that assemblages of fast-growing and light-demanding species are less productive than assemblages of species with different shade tolerances. We examined the hypothesis that mixtures of two fast-growing species compete for resources, while mixtures of shade-tolerant and shade-intolerant species are complementary. Ecophysiological characteristics of young trees were determined and analyzed with a physiology-based canopy model (MAESTRA) to test species interactions. Contrary to predictions, there was evidence for complementary interactions between two fast-growing species with respect to nutrient uptake, nutrient use efficiency, and nutrient cycling. Fast-growing Elaeocarpus angustifolius had maximum demand for soil nutrients in summer, the most efficient internal recycling of N, and low P use efficiency at the leaf and whole-plant level and produced a large amount of nutrient-rich litter. In contrast, fast-growing Grevillea robusta had maximum demand for soil nutrients in spring and highest leaf nutrient use efficiency for N and P and produced low-nutrient litter. Thus, mixtures of fast-growing G. robusta and E. angustifolius or G. robusta and slow-growing, shade-tolerant Castanospermum australe may have similar or even greater productivity than monocultures, as light requirement is just one of several factors affecting performance of mixed-species plantations. We conclude that the knowledge gained here will be useful for designing large-scale experimental mixtures and commercial forestry systems in subtropical Australia and elsewhere.

TI A new parameterization for estimating co-occurrence of interacting

AB Models currently used to estimate patterns of species co-occurrence while accounting for errors in detection of species can be difficult to fit when the effects of covariates on species occurrence probabilities are included. The source of the estimation problems is the particular parameterization used to specify species co-occurrence probability. We develop a new parameterization for estimating patterns of co-occurrence of interacting species that allows the effects of covariates to be specified quite naturally without estimation problems. In our model, the occurrence of one species is assumed to depend on the occurrence of another, but the occurrence of the second species is not assumed to depend on the presence of the first species. This pattern of co-occurrence, wherein one species is dominant and the other is subordinate, can be produced by several types of ecological interactions (predator-prey, parasitism, and so on).
   A simulation study demonstrated that estimates of species occurrence probabilities were unbiased in samples of 50-100 locations and three surveys per location, provided species are easily detected (probability of detection >= 0.5). Higher sample sizes (>200 locations) are needed to achieve unbiasedness when species are more difficult to detect. An analysis of data from treefrog surveys in southern Florida indicated that the occurrence of Cuban treefrogs, an invasive predator species, was highest near the point of its introduction and declined with distance from that location. Sites occupied by Cuban treefrogs were 9.0 times less likely to contain green treefrogs and 15.7 times less likely to contain squirrel treefrogs compared to sites without Cuban treefrogs. The detection probabilities of native treefrog species did not depend on the presence of Cuban treefrogs, suggesting that the native treefrog species are naive to the introduced species.

AB Habitat destruction is one of the primary causes of recent mass extinction of biospecies. Even if the destruction is limited to a local and small area, the cumulative destruction increases the risk of extinction. In this paper, we explore the effect of habitat destruction in lattice ecosystems composed of multiple species. Simulations reveal a parity law: the response of the system shows different behaviors by whether the species richness of system is even or odd. The mean-field theory partially predicts such a parity law. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The array of definitions regarding 'peri-urban' areas do not allow the precise measurement of its boundaries in a city. In this study, I developed an easy-to-use method to calculate the area where urban and adjacent non-urban systems intermingle. To validate that such areas were ecologically meaningful, I compared bird community species-richness, abundance, and composition from 'intra-' and 'peri-urban' areas in a medium-sized neotropical city. Results show that 'peri-urban' areas represent an important ecological interaction area for birds, and differ greatly from 'intra-urban' areas. The proposed method is robust and useful for a great variety of amoeboid-growing cities.

AB Tropical montane species are characterized by narrow elevational distributions. Recent perspectives on mechanisms maintaining these restricted distributions have emphasized abiotic processes, but biotic processes may also play a role in their establishment or maintenance. One historically popular hypothesis, especially for birds, is that interspecific competition constrains ranges of closely related species that "replace" each other along elevational gradients. Supporting evidence, however, is based on patterns of occurrence and does not reveal potential mechanisms. We experimentally tested a prediction of this hypothesis in two genera of tropical songbirds, Catharus (Turdidae) and Henicorhina (Troglodytidae), in which species have nonoverlapping elevational distributions. Using heterospeci. c playback trials, we found that individuals at replacement zones showed aggressive territorial behavior in response to songs of congeners. As distance from replacement zones increased, aggression toward congener song decreased, suggesting a learned component to interspecific aggression. Additionally, aggressive responses in Catharus were asymmetric, indicating interspecific dominance. These results provide experimental evidence consistent with the hypothesis that interspecific competitive interactions restrict ranges of Neotropical birds. Our results also underscore the need to consider biotic processes, such as competition, when predicting how species' ranges will shift with climate change. Asymmetric aggression could be particularly important. For example, if warming in montane landscapes allows upslope range expansion by dominant competitors, then high-elevation subordinate species could be forced into progressively smaller mountaintop habitats, jeopardizing viability of their populations.

AB The influence of landscape structure on marine ecological processes is receiving increasing attention. However, few studies conducted in coastal marine habitats have evaluated whether the effects of landscape structure on species interactions and organismal behavior are consistent across the range of an organism, over which landscape context and the strength of species interactions typically vary. American lobster (Homarus americanus) juveniles seek refuge from predators within shallow rocky habitat but make short-distance movements to forage outside of shelter. We evaluated how the patchiness of cobble habitat influences juvenile lobster movement by conducting mark-recapture experiments on lobsters placed within patchy and contiguous cobble plots in three regions of New England among which risk of predation and intraspecific shelter competition vary (Rhode Island, mid-coast Maine, and eastern Maine, USA). We also evaluated whether habitat patchiness influenced lobster colonization of plots and whether lobster fidelity to individual shelters corresponds to variability in predator abundance and conspecific density among regions. Cobble patchiness reduced rates of lobster movement in all three regions in 2004 and in two of three regions in 2005, despite large differences in landscape context among regions. Region had much larger effects on lobster colonization than did patchiness, but patchy plots were colonized at higher rates than were contiguous plots where lobster densities were highest. Fidelity to shelter was higher in regions with low conspecific density (Rhode Island and eastern Maine) than in mid-coast Maine where conspecific density is high and where unmarked lobsters often occupied shelters vacated by marked lobsters. Our results indicate that cobble patchiness influences juvenile lobster movement at small scales, but that the effects of patchiness on movement were consistent across much of the range of the American lobster despite strong regional variation in predator abundance and conspecific density.

AB In heterogeneous environments, selection on life-history traits and flowering time may vary considerably among populations because of differences in the extent to which mortality is related to age or size, and because of differences in the seasonal patterns of resource availability and intensity of biotic interactions. Spatial variation in optimal reproductive effort and flowering time may result in the evolution of genetic differences in life-history traits, but also in the evolution of adaptive phenotypic plasticity. The perennial herb Primula farinosa occurs at sites that differ widely in soil depth and therefore in water-holding capacity, vegetation cover, and frost-induced soil movement in winter. We used data from eight natural populations and a common-garden experiment to test the predictions that reproductive allocation is negatively correlated with soil depth while age at first reproduction and first flowering date among reproductive individuals are positively correlated with soil depth. In the common-garden experiment, maternal families collected in the field were grown from seed and monitored for 5 years. In the field, reproductive effort (number of flowers in relation to rosette area) varied among populations and was negatively related to soil depth. In the common-garden experiment, among-population differences in age at first reproduction, and reproductive effort were statistically significant, but relatively small and not correlated with soil depth at the site of origin. Flowering time varied considerably among populations, but was not related to soil depth at the site of origin. Taken together, the results suggest that among-population variation in reproductive effort observed in the field largely reflects phenotypic plasticity. They further suggest that among-population differentiation in flowering time cannot be attributed to variation in environmental factors correlated with soil depth.

AB Focus has been placed on the relative importance of environmental heterogeneity and biological interactions on community structure. For land snails, abiotic factors have commonly been assumed to be the most important factors for shaping communities because resources for land snails are commonly not limiting, and because interspecific resource competition would not be strong enough to promote ecological divergence. However, clear divergence in habitat use is often observed among sympatric land snail species. Such an ecological divergence would be promoted not by resource competition but by other interactions such as aggression. To test this hypothesis, laboratory experiments were designed to explore aggressive behaviour in the land snails Euhadra quaesita and E. peliomphala and field surveys were conducted to examine their habitat use. In the laboratory experiments, we examined how the presence of one species affects the growth of the other species by supplying sufficient amounts of food and calcium for both species. Experimental trials showed that adult E. quaesita decreased the growth of E. peliomphala under constant diet conditions. In contrast, E. peliomphala did not affect the growth of E. quaesita. Because E. peliomphala was often attacked by E. quaesita and its shell was often eroded by E. quaesita gnawing, aggression by E. quaesita appears to be the primary factor reducing the growth of E. peliomphala. When the two species coexist in nature, adults and juveniles of E. quaesita are terrestrial, while those of E. peliomphala are arboreal. When these species occurred alone, E. quaesita were still terrestrial, but E. peliomphala were more terrestrial than when they were in sympatry. Our results suggest that habitat use of these species in the natural communities is affected by interspecific interference. These findings further suggest that the divergence of habitat use between the species can occur by aggression even in environments with unlimited resources.

AB P>1. Network analyses provide insights into the diversity and complexity of ecological interactions and have motivated conclusions about community stability and co-evolution. However, biological traits and mechanisms such as chemical signals regulating the interactions between individual species - the microstructure of a network - are poorly understood.
   2. We linked the responses of receivers (flower visitors) towards signals (flower scent) to the structure of a highly diverse natural flower-insect network. For each interaction, we define link temperature - a newly developed metric - as the deviation of the observed interaction strength from neutrality, assuming that animals randomly interact with flowers.
   3. Link temperature was positively correlated to the specific visitors' responses to floral scents, experimentally examined in a mobile olfactometer. Thus, communication between plants and consumers via phytochemical signals reflects a significant part of the microstructure in a complex network. Negative as well as positive responses towards floral scents contributed to these results, where individual experience was important apart from innate behaviour.
   4. Our results indicate that: (1) biological mechanisms have a profound impact on the microstructure of complex networks that underlies the outcome of aggregate statistics, and (2) floral scents act as a filter, promoting the visitation of some flower visitors, but also inhibiting the visitation of others.

AB Aim
   Various techniques model a species' niche and potential distribution by comparing the environmental conditions of occurrence localities with those of the overall study region (via a background or pseudoabsence sample). Here, we examine how changes in the extent of the study region (ignored or under-appreciated in most studies) affect models of two rodents, Nephelomys caracolus and Nephelomys meridensis.
   Location
   North-central South America.
   Methods
   We used Maxent to model the species' potential distributions via two methods of defining the study region. In Method 1 (typical of most studies to date), we calibrated the model in a large study region that included the ranges of both species. In Method 2, we calibrated the model using a smaller study region surrounding the localities of the focal species, and then applied it to the larger region. Because the study region of Method 1 is likely to include areas of suitable conditions that are unoccupied because of dispersal limitations and/or biotic interactions, this approach is prone to overfitting to conditions found near the occupied localities. In contrast, Method 2 should avoid such problems but may require further assumptions ('clamping' in Maxent) to make predictions for areas with environmental conditions beyond those found in the smaller study region. For each method, we calculated several measures of geographic interpredictivity between predictions for the species (cross-species AUC, cross-species omission rate, and proportional geographic overlap).
   Results
   Compared with Method 1, Method 2 revealed a larger predicted area for each species, less concentrated around known localities (especially for N. caracolus). It also led to higher cross-species AUC values, lower cross-species omission rates and higher proportions of geographic overlap. Clamping was minimal and occurred primarily in regions unlikely to be suitable.
   Main conclusions
   Method 2 led to more realistic predictions and higher estimates of niche conservatism. Conclusions reached by many studies depend on the selection of an appropriate study region. Although detailed information regarding dispersal limitations and/or biotic interactions will typically be difficult to obtain, consideration of coarse distributional patterns, topography and vegetational zones often should permit delimitation of a much more reasonable study region than the extremely large ones currently in common use.

AB The concept of ecosystem engineering has catalysed novel approaches and models for non-trophic species interactions and ecosystem functions. Ecosystem engineers physically modify abiotic and biotic environments, thereby creating new habitats that can be colonized by a new suite of species. In the Peruvian Amazonas, we tested whether peccaries (Tayassuidae) function as ecosystem engineers by creating and maintaining wallows. Such wallows could be critical aquatic habitats and breeding sites for anuran species during dry seasons. We compared hydroperiods of 21 peccary wallows and 13 naturally formed ponds across three dry seasons and found that wallows had a consistently higher mean water surface area than ponds. We also examined the pH. dissolved oxygen and temperature, and found no significant differences in these parameters between water bodies. Wallows had a significantly higher density of tadpoles, metamorphs and adult anurans, as well as higher beta-diversity and species richness than ponds. This study not only provides the first systematic evidence of the ecosystem engineering processes of peccaries. but also reveals the positive consequences of such for anuran species.

AB Soil nutrients, and factors which influence their concentrations and bioavailability, form a basic component of bottom-up control of ecosystem processes, including plant-herbivore interactions. Increased nutrient levels are linked, through plant defence theory, with increased levels of herbivore susceptibility. The focal point of many ecological experiments examining this link is at the species level, where the response of single species is the average of many different genotypes. Here, we focus on the genetic basis of indirect ecological interactions. We investigated the effects of nutrient concentration on the population growth of an aphid herbivore across multiple genotypes of barley in relation to plant growth rate. In general, both aphid population size and plant growth rate increased with nutrient concentration. However, they were both dependent on the interaction between nutrient concentration and barley genotype. Our data raise the testable possibility of differential defense responses between genotypes of barley, for example divergent, fixed and inducible defences against aphids. We provide evidence that the indirect effects of soil nutrients on aphid population size are mediated by the genetics of the host plant.

AB Here we clarify some of the assumptions made in the application of the two most commonly used indices for measuring the strengths of species interactions with manipulative removal/addition experiments: Paine's index and the dynamic index. We explain how the values these indices are intended to measure - the per capita interaction strength between two species - are typically not estimated in common currencies. We then introduce extensions to these indices that alleviate a subset of previously made assumptions and limitations. These include a reformulation of Paine's index appropriate for an open-recruitment system, and an extension of the dynamic index applicable to interactions of a particular nonlinear form. While we focus our language on predator-prey interactions, our discussions are pertinent to the measurement of species effects in other types of interactions as well (Mitchell and Wass 1996, Freckleton et al. 2009).

AB Dung fauna plays an important role in dung decomposition, a key ecosystem process in nutrient cycling in grazed grasslands. The diversity of a three-species community (dung beetles, dung flies and epigeic earthworms) was systematically manipulated to produce different relative abundance distributions (evenness levels) and the resulting communities were introduced to standardised dung pats in laboratory experiments. Dung decomposition was modelled using an analysis that disentangled species identity effects and the interactions among species that contribute to the diversity effect. This revealed that the net diversity effect was composed of positive (fly-earthworm), negative (beetle-earthworm) and neutral (fly-beetle) effects of species interaction. These pairwise interactions resulted in complex, but systematically varying and predictable effects on dung decomposition as the relative abundances of species changed. Decomposition was consistently greater in communities with higher decomposer biomass. The utility of the adopted analytical approach was emphasised by comparison with an ANOVA that found that dung decomposition did not differ among evenness levels. Thus, the averaging of decomposition across different community structures within evenness levels masked the different effects of species interactions. These results highlight methodological insights into the quantification of diversity-function relationships.

AB Fungal pathogens can regulate the abundance and distribution of natural plant populations by inhibiting the growth, survival, and reproduction of their hosts. The abiotic environment is a crucial component in host-pathogen interactions in natural plant populations as favorable conditions drive pathogen development, reproduction, and persistence. Foliar plant pathogens, such as fungal lesions referred to generically as "leaf spot disease," are particularly responsive to increased moisture levels, but the manner in which the abiotic environment drives disease dynamics, and how these diseases regulate natural plant populations, is not fully understood. We investigate (1) the impact of ambient soil moisture and diffuse light on the prevalence of a leaf spot pathogen (Phyllosticta sp.) in a natural population of Polygonatum biflorum, an understory herb native to deciduous forest understories in the eastern US, and (2) the effects of the fungal pathogen on the survival, growth, and abundance of the plants. We tracked six P. biflorum populations and disease incidence, as well as soil moisture and diffuse light, between 2003 and 2005 in the understory deciduous forest of the southern Appalachian Mountains, North Carolina, USA. Results show that both the occurrence of P. biflorum and the prevalence of P. biflorum leaf spot disease are highest where soil moisture is intermediate and diffuse light is lowest. Disease occurrence depends upon plant presence, but it also adversely impacts plant survival, abundance, and growth. These results suggest that leaf spot disease is likely to impact population dynamics, which in turn vary as a function of environmental drivers.

AB The relationship between species number and island area is a fundamental rule in ecology. However, the extent to which interactions with exotic species and how the structure of species interactions is related to island area remain unexplored. Here, I document the relationship between island area and (i) interactions with exotic species and (ii) network structure of species interactions in the context of mutualistic interactions between ants and extrafloral nectary-bearing plants on the oceanic Ogasawara (Bonin) Islands, Japan. Pooled data contained 122 interactions among 19 plant (including five exotic) and 23 ant (including 20 exotic) species. Of the observed interactions, 82.8 per cent involved at least one exotic species, ranging from 68.2 to 86.4 per cent among islands. The number of links including exotic species increased in proportion to island area, although the number of links excluding exotic species did not. These results indicate that the number of interactions with exotic species increased in proportion to island area. Connectance, or the proportion of interactions actually observed among all possible interactions, decreased with island area. Nestedness, an asymmetry index in the species interaction network, also decreased with island area. Therefore, island area affects both the number of interactions with exotic species and the network structure.

AB Considerable research has documented the effects of ozone on crop plants, but little experimental work has examined the effects of ozone on natural vegetation. Our objective was to determine how a plant community responds over several generations to elevated ozone exposures. Seed bank soil collected from the Oregon State University Farm, containing a population of naturalized plants common to the Willamette Valley, was uniformly dispersed across the surface of nine modified open top chambers. Each chamber was randomly assigned one of three ozone treatments (0, 90 and 120 ppb episodic ozone). Sixty plant species from 22 families emerged in the chambers over the four year study. Seedling emergence was a highly sensitive period. High seedling mortality rates in the ozone treatments allowed more resistant individuals to persist. Communities not exposed to elevated ozone levels also had high rates of mortality probably due to density dependant mortality. No species were eliminated from the communities because of ozone. Plant species did not demonstrate ozone tolerance or susceptibility based on taxonomic relationships. Year-to-year environmental heterogeneity was a stronger influence on community composition than ozone exposures. At the community level, there was a trend of decreasing biomass with increasing ozone exposure. In the ozone treatments, premature senescence of taller species increased light availability to understory species, changing competitive interactions and altering community dynamics in the understory. The effects of ozone on individual species, both direct and indirect, in a community may be detrimental, insignificant, or positive. Predication of a species performance in a community will be difficult due to the many environmental and biological interactions occurring simultaneously or at alternative times during a specific species life cycle. Studies are necessary to decrease the uncertainty in attempting to assess the impact of ozone on both managed and natural ecosystems currently determined from extrapolating the effects on individuals. Currently, plant communities remain protected at an unknown level from ozone exposure. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB When dealing with sustainability, we are concerned with the biophysical and the monetary aspects of economic and ecological interactions. This multidimensional approach requires that special attention is paid to dimensional issues. However, many studies in economics, as well as in ecological economics, apply dimensional numbers to exponential or logarithmic functions. We show first that it is an analytical error to put a dimensional number x into exponential functions (e) and logarithmic functions (log ox). We introduce several examples of this analytical error both in ecological economics and conventional economics. These observations are presented with the hope that they will orient future quantitative analyses toward more constructive ends. Since the empirical and theoretical studies in economics often adopt the logarithmic specification of the production and cost function, we derive a procedure or an algorithm, concerned with the given data set, by which we can examine whether or not a particular logarithmic specification is superior to the usual regression specification in terms of the least square norm.

AB Phenological dynamics are controlled by environmental factors, disturbance regimes and species interactions that alter growth or mortality risk. Ecosystem engineers can be a key source of disturbance, yet their effects on the phenologies of co-occurring organisms are virtually unexplored. We investigated how the abundance of a dominant ecosystem engineer, spawning sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), alters the emergence phenology of stream insects. In streams with high densities of salmon, peak insect emergence occurred in early July, immediately prior to salmon spawning. By contrast, peak insect emergence in streams with low densities of salmon was weeks later and more protracted. The emergence of specific taxa was also significantly related to salmon density. A common rearing experiment revealed that differences in emergence timing are maintained in the absence of spawning salmon. We hypothesize that these patterns are probably driven by predictable and severe disturbance from nest-digging salmon driving local adaptation and being a trait filter of insect emergence. Thus, salmon regulate the timing and duration of aquatic insect emergence, a cross-ecosystem flux from streams to riparian systems.

AB Large-scale changes to the world's ecosystem are resulting in the deterioration of biostructure-the complex web of species interactions that make up ecological communities. A difficult, yet crucial task is to identify food web structures, or food web motifs, that are the building blocks of this baroque network of interactions. Once identified, these food web motifs can then be examined through experiments and theory to provide mechanistic explanations for how structure governs ecosystem stability. Here, we synthesize recent ecological research to show that generalist consumers coupling resources with different interaction strengths, is one such motif. This motif amazingly occurs across an enormous range of spatial scales, and so acts to distribute coupled weak and strong interactions throughout food webs. We then perform an experiment that illustrates the importance of this motif to ecological stability. We find that weak interactions coupled to strong interactions by generalist consumers dampen strong interaction strengths and increase community stability. This study takes a critical step by isolating a common food web motif and through clear, experimental manipulation, identifies the fundamental stabilizing consequences of this structure for ecological communities.

AB Whether plant distributions are governed more by neutral-based distance effects or niche-based environmental responses remains elusive. A lack of habitat matching, where species distributions do not correspond to environmental variability, suggests neutrality but can also be explained by niche models through the interactions of dispersal limitation, spatial autocorrelation of the environment, species interactions, and spatial scale. We untangle these effects in a field study with multiscale statistical analyses. We demonstrate that despite significant niche-based environmental responses by a savanna plant, we still see weak habitat matching, with the mechanisms responsible differing by spatial scale. At the coarse scale (100-200 m), dispersal limitation restricted the occupation of optimal habitat. At the fine scale (<30 m), dispersal was not limiting, but a lack of autocorrelation of environmental variables prevented the aggregation of reproductively active plants in optimal microsites. Species associations were largely unimportant at all scales. Extending our analysis to the entire community revealed similar scale-dependent limitations of distance and the environment, indicating weak habitat matching for all species. This work supports predictions that environmental specializations do not necessarily produce deterministic distributions in plant communities. It also provides a mechanistic explanation for why co-occurring plant species can have largely undifferentiated distributions.

AB The mutualistic symbiosis between fungus-gardening ants and their cultivars has made fundamental contributions to our understanding of the coevolution of complex species interactions. Reciprocal specialization and vertical symbiont cotransmission are thought to promote a pattern of largely synchronous coevolutionary diversification in attines. Here we test this hypothesis by inferring the first time-calibrated multigene phylogeny of the lepiotaceous attine cultivars and comparing it with the recently published fossil-anchored phylogeny of the attine ants. While this comparison reveals some possible cases of synchronous origins of ant and fungal clades, there were a number of surprising asynchronies. For example, leaf-cutter cultivars appear to be significantly younger than the corresponding ant genera. Similarly, a clade of fungi interacting with primitive fungus-gardening ants-thought to be ancestral to the more derived leaf-cutter symbionts-appears instead to be a more recent acquisition from free-living stock. These macroevolutionary patterns are consistent with recent population-level studies suggesting occasional acquisition of novel cultivar types from environmental sources and horizontal transmission of cultivars between different ant species. Horizontal transmission events, even if rare, appear to form loose ecological connections between diffusely coevolving ant and fungus lineages that permit punctuated changes in the topology of the mutualistic ant-fungus interaction network.

AB Increasing evidence shows that anthropogenic climate change is affecting biodiversity. Reducing or stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions may slow global warming, but past emissions will continue to contribute to further unavoidable warming for more than a century. With obvious signs of difficulties in achieving effective mitigation worldwide in the short term at least, sound scientific predictions of future impacts on biodiversity will be required to guide conservation planning and adaptation. This is especially true in Mediterranean type ecosystems that are projected to be among the most significantly affected by anthropogenic climate change, and show the highest levels of confidence in rainfall projections. Multiple methods are available for projecting the consequences of climate change on the main unit of interest - the species - with each method having strengths and weaknesses. Species distribution models (SDMs) are increasingly applied for forecasting climate change impacts on species geographic ranges. Aggregation of models for different species allows inferences of impacts on biodiversity, though excluding the effects of species interactions. The modelling approach is based on several further assumptions and projections and should be treated cautiously. In the absence of comparable approaches that address large numbers of species, SDMs remain valuable in estimating the vulnerability of species. In this review we discuss the application of SDMs in predicting the impacts of climate change on biodiversity with special reference to the species-rich South West Australian Floristic Region and South African Cape Floristic Region. We discuss the advantages and challenges in applying SDMs in biodiverse regions with high levels of endemicity, and how a similar biogeographical history in both regions may assist us in understanding their vulnerability to climate change. We suggest how the process of predicting the impacts of climate change on biodiversity with SDMs can be improved and emphasize the role of field monitoring and experiments in validating the predictions of SDMs.

AB The Mediterranean climate regions of Western Australia and South Africa are recognized as global hot spots of diversity. Both are threatened by climate changes that are projected to have significant impacts on the quantity and variability of rainfall and affect key ecosystem drivers (e.g. fire regimes). This poses significant challenges to monitoring programs designed to detect these impacts. Effective monitoring of the impact of climate change on biodiversity (rather than individual species) requires a cross-disciplinary, coordinated, focused and integrated approach. Ideally, this should involve a multidisciplinary team of specialists working to a common plan on the same set of plots. The contributions of 'citizen scientists' are potentially useful if well managed. Biodiversity per se (across all kingdoms of life, and including the levels of the gene, population and community) should be monitored, especially key species interactions and processes. Forestcheck is an example of such a program which has been applied in forests in south-west Western Australia since 2001. In concert with measuring the direct impact of climate change on biodiversity and the indirect impact of factors that affect biodiversity (such as disease, invasive species, fire regime and habitat removal), there is a need for a proactive focus on creating, maintaining and monitoring resilience to climate change impacts in ecosystems. It is also necessary to monitor the effectiveness of management actions such as vegetation thinning, changes in fire regimes, species translocations and revegetation of farmland to link isolated protected areas in agricultural landscapes, remnant native vegetation in rangelands and extensive protected areas. A pluralist approach is recommended. This should include natural experiments, matched photographs where available, passive adaptive management, active adaptive management and traditional reductionist scientific investigation. The resultant synthesis of information from this range of sources is likely to be a predictive, robust and credible record of historical change.

   PERSPECTIVE
AB Leiopelma hochstetteri is an endangered New Zealand frog now confined to isolated populations scattered across the North Island. A better understanding of its past, current and predicted future environmental suitability will contribute to its conservation which is in jeopardy due to human activities, feral predators, disease and climate change. Here we use ecological niche modelling with all known occurrence data (N = 1708) and six determinant environmental variables to elucidate current, pre-human and future environmental suitability of this species. Comparison among independent runs, subfossil records and a clamping method allow validation of models. Many areas identified as currently suitable do not host any known populations. This apparent discrepancy could be explained by several non exclusive hypotheses: the areas have not been adequately surveyed and undiscovered populations still remain, the model is over simplistic; the species' sensitivity to fragmentation and small population size; biotic interactions; historical events. An additional outcome is that apparently suitable, but frog-less areas could be targeted for future translocations. Surprisingly, pre-human conditions do not differ markedly highlighting the possibility that the range of the species was broadly fragmented before human arrival. Nevertheless, some populations, particularly on the west of the North Island may have disappeared as a result of human mediated habitat modification. Future conditions are marked with higher temperatures, which are predicted to be favourable to the species. However, such virtual gain in suitable range will probably not benefit the species given the highly fragmented nature of existing habitat and the low dispersal ability of this species.

AB Since the 1990s the Rio de La Plata basin has been widely colonized by the invader mollusk Limnoperna fortunei. In spite of a relatively well-developed knowledge of the biology and ecology of this mollusk, not much is known about its natural diet and possible food selectivity. Stomach contents of 120 specimens attached to the roots of Eichhornia crassipes, and available planktonic food sources, taken from seven representative environments of the Parana River floodplain, were analyzed. The diet consisted of 156 taxa with a wide size range (2-1,178 mu m) and representing a great variety of organisms. Phytoplankton was dominant in abundance (98.6% of the total diet), while zooplankton, mainly small cladocerans, was dominant in volume (67% of the total diet). L. fortunei showed a positive food selectivity for organisms with limited escape ability and low to moderate size (Euglenophyta, Rotifera, Chydoridae and Bosminidae), and a negative selectivity for many algae. Therefore, the plankton community structure would be changed due to this differential predation pressure. These are the first observations about the feeding of L. fortunei upon zooplankton. The results of the present study agree, in general, with those of descriptive field studies and laboratory experiments on the effect of Dreissena polymorpha on zooplankton, but differ in some aspects. The differences suggest the possibility of different impacts on the ecosystem, and a probable complementary coexistence in potentially 'invadable' environments. Ecological interaction between L. fortunei and the invasive hydrophyte Eichhornia crassipes suggests a possible synergistic effect on the distributional efficiency of the mollusk.

TI Tourism disassembles patterns of co-occurrence and weakens responses to

AB The impact of disturbance on animal and plant assemblages has been described mainly in terms of aggregate community properties like species richness, abundance, or productivity. However, the question how disturbance acts on species interactions, particularly on patterns of co-occurrence, has received much less attention. Here we use a large pitfall trap sample of spiders from two complexes of lake islands in Northern Poland to show how disturbance by tourist visits affects species richness, composition and co-occurrence. On the pristine and protected islands of Lake Wigry, species co-occurrence was significantly segregated. Further, island species richness and abundances could be predicted from environmental correlates, particularly from island area, soil fertility and humidity. In turn, on the lake islands that are frequently visited by tourists, species co-occurrences were random and environmental correlates other than island area failed to predict species richness and abundances. However, species composition, alpha-, beta-, and gamma-diversities, as well as average local spider abundances did not significantly differ between both island complexes. Our results show that disturbance disassembles the structure of spider communities prior to visible richness and abundance effects. This result has implications for biological conservation. The detection of community disassembly might be an early sign for factors that act negatively on ecosystem functioning.

AB Competition and facilitation are expected to leave different signatures in the pattern of species co-occurence. Competition may result in a given species pair occuring less often than expected by chance, whereas facilitation may result in a given species pair occuring more often than expected by chance. We assessed the co-occurence of pairs of herbaceous and shrubby species in Brazilian savannas, asking (1) whether a given species pair occurs more often than expected by chance, (2) whether the number of species pairs in sites with frequent fires is higher than expected by chance, (3) whether the difference in the functional traits of heterospecific pairs is lower in sites with frequent fires, and (4) whether small environmental variations in each site - instead of species interactions - could explain the co-occurence of species. We used null models to answer the first two questions, analyses of variance to answer the third question, and detrended correspondence analyses to answer the fourth question. In all studied sites, approximately half of the heterospecific pairs occured more often than expected by chance. So, facilitation seems to be important in determining the co-occurence of some species in Brazilian savannas. However, high fire frequencies changed the pattern of occurrence of the species pairs, resulting in a spatial signature indistinguishable from random. Frequent fires also promoted phenotypic clustering of species. Neverthless, wherever fire frequency is reduced, competition may lead to phenotypic overdispersion of plant species. Thus, less harsh environmental conditions in savannas may increase the competition among plant species.

AB Understanding patterns in taxonomic congruency and the importance of environmental variables as drivers of these patterns is a prerequisite for analyzing changes in regional species pools. Here we evaluated the spatial correspondence of benthic diatoms, invertebrates, macrophytes, and fish assemblages in minimally disturbed lowland (n = 38) and mountain (n = 32) streams and, using constrained ordination and variance decomposition, determined how environmental and biological variables related to these patterns. Using different measures of diversity, abundance, and community composition, principal components analysis failed to reveal a single gradient in lowland and mountain streams. This was due to differences in the relationships between individual diversity measures and environmental variables characterizing habitat diversity (number of debris dams, silt and cobble substratum) in lowland streams, and catchment area and oxygen saturation in mountain streams. Despite the low spatial coherence of individual measures, integral multivariate analyses of community structure revealed coherent patterns between taxonomic groups. From 31.0% to 47.7% of the variance in diversity of. sh, invertebrate, and macrophyte assemblages in mountain streams and from 11.9% to 33.7% of the variance in diversity in lowland streams were explained by one or more of the remaining three groups. Partial redundancy analyses showed that composition of other taxonomic groups was generally a better predictor of assemblage diversity than interactions with environmental variables, lending support to the importance of species interactions for spatial coherence. Finally, although we found little support for a single biodiversity gradient, correlations between. sh diversity and macrophyte and invertebrate diversity in mountain streams and between macrophyte diversity and invertebrate and diatom diversity in lowland streams suggest that these two groups (i.e.,. sh in mountain and macrophytes in lowland streams) may function as surrogate indicators for the diversity of other taxonomic groups.

AB Indirect ecological effects (IEEs) clearly influence species dynamics and abundance, yet relatively little is known about how they influence the evolution of species involved. While genetic variation in the species causing and responding to the IEE has obvious effects, the influence of genetic variation in intermediate species remains unexamined. Given the often counterintuitive responses of populations to IEEs this seems a significant omission. Following a community genetics approach, we used a model tetra-trophic system (parasitoid wasp, aphid, barley, and rhizobacteria) to investigate the effect of genetic interactions within the two linking species (aphids and barley) on the IEE of rhizobacteria on wasps. We show that 12.4% of the variation in wasp size, a proxy for fitness, is explained by higher-order interactions between aphid genotype (A), barley genotype (B), and presence or absence of rhizobacteria (R) (Genotype([B]) x Genotype([A]) x Environment([R])). Thus, the IEE of rhizobacteria on the parasitoid wasp is influenced by the specific combination of aphid and barley genotypes that mediate the interactions. In some cases changes in the genotypes of the intermediate species completely reverse the effect of rhizobacteria on wasp size. Our work demonstrates that within-species genetic variation is important in shaping IEEs in communities, an essential component of community evolutionary processes.

AB Human activities drive biotic homogenization (loss of regional diversity) of many taxa. However, whether species interaction networks (e.g., food webs) can also become homogenized remains largely unexplored. Using 48 quantitative parasitoid-host networks replicated through space and time across five tropical habitats, we show that deforestation greatly homogenized network structure at a regional level, such that interaction composition became more similar across rice and pasture sites compared with forested habitats. This was not simply caused by altered consumer and resource community composition, but was associated with altered consumer foraging success, such that parasitoids were more likely to locate their hosts in deforested habitats. Furthermore, deforestation indirectly homogenized networks in time through altered mean consumer and prey body size, which decreased in deforested habitats. Similar patterns were obtained with binary networks, suggesting that interaction (link) presence-absence data may be sufficient to detect network homogenization effects. Our results show that tropical agroforestry systems can support regionally diverse parasitoid-host networks, but that removal of canopy cover greatly homogenizes the structure of these networks in space, and to a lesser degree in time. Spatiotemporal homogenization of interaction networks may alter coevolutionary outcomes and reduce ecological resilience at regional scales, but may not necessarily be predictable from community changes observed within individual trophic levels.

AB How the combination of positive and negative species interactions acts to drive community dynamics is a fundamental question in ecology. Here we explore one aspect of this question by expanding the theory of predator-mediated coexistence to include the potential role of facilitation between the predator and inferior competitor. To motivate and illustrate our simple model, we focus on sea-urchin-algae interactions in temperate rocky reef systems and incorporate recruitment facilitation, a common characteristic of marine systems. Specifically, the model represents sea urchin grazing on macroalgae, macroalgal competition with crustose coralline algae (CCA), and facilitation of sea urchin recruitment to CCA. These interactions generate alternative stable states, one dominated by macroalgae and the other by urchins, which do not occur when recruitment facilitation of urchins to CCA is ignored. Therefore, recruitment facilitation provides a possible mechanism for alternative kelp forest and urchin barren states in temperate marine systems, where storm events or harvesting of urchins or their predators can drive switches between states that are difficult to reverse. In systems with such dynamics, spatial management such as no-take marine reserves may play a crucial role in protecting community structure by increasing the resilience to shifts between states.

AB All communities vary through time. This variability originates from both intrinsic and extrinsic sources. Intrinsic sources are due to actions of organisms in a community, i.e., population dynamics and species interactions, while extrinsic variability is variability created by elements of habitat or environmental change. There is a growing appreciation that these two sources may interact, producing patterns of community variability that cannot be predicted or explained by focusing on a single source. We performed a field experiment that simultaneously manipulated trophic structure (intrinsic) and habitat heterogeneity (extrinsic) in order to examine the interaction between sources of variability in a South Carolina (USA) stream macroinvertebrate community. To manipulate trophic structure, we experimentally altered local abundances of crayfish which are keystone species and ecosystem engineers, while our manipulation of habitat was to alter stream substrate heterogeneity. We focused on two types of community variability as responses to our manipulations: aggregate variability (i.e., variability of summed species) and compositional variability (i.e., variability in relative abundances of species) by monitoring community composition through a 10-week experiment. We found that community dynamics shifted from patterns in variability indicative of synchrony (high aggregate variability + low compositional) to variability indicative of compensation (low aggregate variability + high compositional) along a gradient of increasing habitat heterogeneity. However, the shift in community dynamics only occurred when crayfish were present in the community. Supporting evidence from the experiment suggested that sediment engineering effects of crayfish acted as a community-wide perturbation in low-heterogeneity habitat creating synchronous dynamics. However, in high-heterogeneity enclosures, crayfish effects were moderated by refugia provided by a more complex substratum. The switch from synchronous to compensatory dynamics is significant since compensation stabilizes aggregate community properties and ecosystem functions while synchrony frequently exacerbates aggregate variability. Results from this experiment demonstrate that an interaction between intrinsic and extrinsic sources of variability can alter community dynamics and that such an alteration does not occur in the absence of an interaction.

AB Among anthropogenic effects on the ocean, fishing is one of the most pervasive and extends deepest into the past. Because fishing reduces the density of fish (reducing transmission efficiency of directly transmitted parasites), selectively removes large fish (which tend to carry more parasites than small fish), and reduces food web complexity (reducing transmission efficiency of trophically transmitted parasites), the removal of fish from the world's oceans over the course of hundreds of years may be driving a long-term, global decline in fish parasites. There has been growing recognition in recent years that parasites are a critical part of biodiversity and that their loss could substantially alter ecosystem function. Such a loss may be among the last major ecological effects of industrial fishing to be recognized by scientists.

AB Correlations between phenotypic traits are common in many organisms, but the relative importance of nonadaptive mechanisms and selection for the evolution and maintenance of such correlations are poorly understood. In polymorphic species, morphs may evolve quantitative differences in additional characters as a result of morph-specific selection. The perennial rosette herb Primula farinosa is polymorphic for scape length. The short-scaped morph is less damaged by grazers and seed predators but is more strongly pollen limited than the long-scaped morph. We examined whether morph-specific differences in biotic interactions are associated with differences in selection on two other traits affecting floral display (number of flowers and petal size) and on one trait likely to affect pollination efficiency (corolla tube width) in three P. farinosa populations. Differences in selection between morphs were detected in one population. In this population, selection for more flowers and larger petals was stronger in the short-scaped than in the long-scaped morph, and although there was selection for narrower corolla tubes in the short-scaped morph, no statistically significant selection on corolla tube width could be detected in the long-scaped morph. In the study populations, the short-scaped morph produced more and larger flowers and wider corolla tubes. Current morph-specific selection was thus only partly consistent with trait differences between morphs. The results provide evidence of morph-specific selection on traits associated with floral display and pollination efficiency, respectively.

AB The opportunity for a mutation to invade a population can dramatically vary depending on the context in which this mutation occurs. Such context dependence is difficult to document as it requires the ability to measure how a mutation affects phenotypes and fitness and to manipulate the context in which the mutation occurs. We identified a mutation in a gene encoding a global regulator in one of two ecotypes that diverged from a common ancestor during 1200 generations of experimental evolution. We replaced the ancestral allele by the mutant allele, and vice versa, in several clones isolated during the time course of the evolution experiment, and compared the phenotype and fitness of clones isogenic except for the focal mutation. We show that the fitness and phenotype of the mutation are strongly affected by epistatic interactions between genes in the same genome, as well as by frequency dependent selection resulting from biotic interactions between individuals in the same population. We conclude that amongst the replicate population in which it spread, the mutation we identified is only adaptive when occurring in specific genomes and competing with specific individuals. This study thus demonstrates that the opportunity for an adaptive mutation to spread in an evolutionary lineage can only be understood in the light of its genomic and competitive environments.

AB Modelling habitat of species necessitates robust identification of relevant environmental variables linked to species distribution. To achieve this, we connect hierarchical patch theory and habitat modelling at multiple scales. We suggest discriminating between 'circumstancial variables' and 'process variables' on the basis of temporal evolution of the spatial links between species distribution and their environment at different scales. 'Process variables' are informative of the ecological processes driving the distribution of organisms at multiple scales. By opposition, 'circumstantial variable' provide little insight because their relationship with animal spatial distribution is subject to great variations through time. As a real case study, we investigate the relationships between auk distribution (mainly Uria aalge) and oceanographic landscapes over two scales (i.e. large similar to 200 km and medium similar to 50 km) during the wintering season in the Bay of Biscay. Surface salinity, mixed layer depth and chlorophyll a are identified as 'process variables' as they are invariably correlated with the spatial distribution of auks, whereas bottom temperature can be viewed as a 'circumstantial variable' since the correlation is non-constant through time at large scale. The process variables at large scale are used to model the potential habitat of auks in the Bay of Biscay during the wintering season. At medium scale, only the chlorophyll a is identified as 'process variable' and used to model preferential habitat of wintering auks in the Bay of Biscay. The analytical approach proposed here (i.e. multivariate factorial kriging in a temporal context) is an effective framework to model the potential and preferential habitat of a species and can be related to the ecological niche concept and by focusing explicitly on scale dependence, the distinction between the variables that can be used as niche descriptors into species distribution models. Then our method lead to the identification of variables that should be used to define the Grinnellian niche which is defined by environmental conditions on broad scales and the Eltonian niche which focuses on biotic interactions and resource-consumer dynamics that can be measured principally at local scales.

AB Trait-based resource competition in plants, wherein more similar plants compete more strongly for resources, is a foundation of niche-based explanations for the maintenance of diversity in plant communities. Alternatively, neutral theory predicts that community diversity can be maintained despite equivalent resource requirements among species. We examined interactions at three life history stages (germination, survival, and juvenile-adult growth) for three native and three exotic California annual species in a glasshouse experiment. We varied plant density and species composition in small pots, with pots planted with either intraspecific seeds or in a three species mix of intra- and interspecific neighbors. We saw a range of facilitative, neutral, and competitive interactions that varied significantly by species, rather than by native or exotic status. There were more competitive interactions at the emergence and juvenile-adult growth stages and more facilitative interactions for survival. Consequently, the relative strength of competition in intraspecific versus mixed-species communities depended on whether we considered only the juvenile-adult growth stage or the entire life history of the interacting plants. Using traditional analysis of juvenile-adult growth only, all species showed negative density-dependent interactions for final biomass production. However, when the net effect of plant interactions from seed to adult was considered, which is a prediction of population growth, two native species ceased to show negative density dependence, and the difference between intraspecific and mixed-species competition was only significant for one exotic species. Results were consistent with predictions of neutral, rather than niche, theory for five of six species.

AB In the present study we assess the contribution of C-3, C-4 and intermediate C-3-C-4 plant species to the diet of both native (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris, Rhea americana and Logostomus maximus) and introduced (cattle) herbivore species and the abundance of these photosynthetic plant types in different environments of the lower section of the Parana Basin, Argentina. with similar climate but different hydrological regimes Data of current plants species and their photosynthetic pathways, both form vegetation and the (het. were compiled from literature The analysis of annual diets conducted in terms of photosynthetic types showed that the feeding patterns of native as well introduced herbivores varied both spatially and temporally At each site, the analysis of vegetation and the diet of herbivores in spring in that the feeding patterns may depend not only on vegetation availability. but also on the preferences of herbivores and inter-specific interactions under limited resource conditions These attributes should be taken Into account when interpreting the diet of fossil herbivores from isotopic carbon information Also, the studies on photosynthetic groups enhance our understanding of the relationship between paleodiets and paleoenvironments

AB Although perturbations from a stable equilibrium must ultimately vanish, they can grow initially, and the maximum initial growth rate is called reactivity. Reactivity thus identifies systems that may undergo transient population surges or drops in response to perturbations; however, we lack biological and mathematical intuition about what makes a system reactive. This paper presents upper and lower bounds on reactivity for an arbitrary linearized model, explores their strictness, and discusses their biological implications. I find that less stable systems (i.e. systems with long transients) have a smaller possible range of reactivities for which no perturbations grow. Systems with more species have a higher capacity to be reactive, assuming species interactions do not weaken too rapidly as the number of species increases. Finally, I find that in discrete time, reactivity is determined largely by mean interaction strength and neither discrete nor continuous time reactivity are sensitive to food web topology.

AB Predicting the impacts of climate change on species is one of the biggest challenges that ecologists face. Predictions routinely focus on the direct effects of climate change on individual species, yet interactions between species can strongly influence how climate change affects organisms at every scale by altering their individual fitness, geographic ranges and the structure and dynamics of their community. Failure to incorporate these interactions limits the ability to predict responses of species to climate change. We propose a framework based on ideas from global-change biology, community ecology, and invasion biology that uses community modules to assess how species interactions shape responses to climate change.

AB More-diverse communities are thought to be ecologically stable because a greater number of ecological interactions among members allows for the increases in robustness and resilience. Diversity-stability relationships have mostly been studied on short ecological time scales but one study has identified such patterns over million-year time scales in reef communities. Here we propose and test a hypothesis for the mechanism of large-scale diversity-stability relationships in reefs. The extinction of community members destabilizes the community as a whole, unless there is sufficient diversity to buffer the community from the stochastic loss of members, thereby preventing collapse. If genera have high extinction rates, any variation in diversity among communities will result in a diversity-stability relationship. Conversely, in the absence of other mechanisms, the stability of low extinction communities is expected to be independent of diversity. We compare the extinction rates of six reef-building metazoan taxa to patterns of reef community stability and reef volume. We find that extinction of reef-builders occurs independent of reef volume, and that the strength of the diversity-stability relationship varies positively with extinction rate.

More recently, such approaches have been used as a means to evaluate support for the geographic mosaic theory of coevolution. Here we examine the utility of these approaches, using mathematical and computational models to predict the correlation that evolves between traits of interacting species for a broad range of interaction types. Our results reveal that coevolution is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for the evolution of spatially correlated traits between two species. Specifically, our results show that coevolutionary selection fails to consistently generate statistically significant correlations and, conversely, that non-coevolutionary processes can readily cause statistically significant correlations to evolve. In addition, our results demonstrate that studies of trait correlations per se cannot be used as evidence either for or against a geographic mosaic process. Taken together, our results suggest that understanding the coevolutionary process in natural populations will require detailed mechanistic studies conducted in multiple populations or the use of more sophisticated statistical approaches that better use information contained in existing data sets.

AB In rain forest, the large numbers of species of fleshy-fruited plants and frugivorous animals result in a large number of potential fruit-frugivore interactions, which are challenging to survey in the field. Yet, knowledge of these relationships is needed to predict consequences of changes in the frugivore assemblage for seed dispersal. In the absence of comprehensive dietary information, it may be possible to delineate between frugivores that disperse different plants using 'functional traits,' or morphological and behavioral attributes of frugivores that interact with differences in salient characteristics of plant species. Here we use data on the consumption of 244 Australian rain forest plant species by 38 bird species to test for associations between patterns of frugivory and birds': (1) degree of frugivory, (2) gape width, and (3) seed treatment (seed crushing or seed dispersing). Degree of frugivory and gape width explain 74 percent of the variation in the sizes of fruits consumed by frugivorous birds. Among birds that consume a substantial dietary proportion of fruit, birds with wider gapes consume larger fruits. In contrast, this relationship was not shown by birds for which fruit is only a minor dietary component. Degree of frugivory and gape width, together with seed treatment, also strongly predict the overall taxonomic composition and diversity of plants consumed by bird species. Functional classifications of frugivore species may prove useful in developing a predictive understanding of fruit-frugivore interactions in other rain forest regions where detailed dietary information is not available for most frugivores.

AB Host populations with high genetic diversity are predicted to have lower levels of infection prevalence. This theory assumes that host genetic diversity results in variation in susceptibility and that parasites exhibit variation in infectivity. Empirical studies on the effects of host heterogeneity typically neglect the role of parasite diversity. We conducted three laboratory experiments designed to test if genetic variation in Daphnia magna populations and genetic variation in its parasites together influence the course of parasite spread after introduction. We found that a natural D. magna population exhibited variation in susceptibility to infection by three parasite species and had strong host clone parasite species interactions. There was no effect of host heterogeneity in experimental host populations (polycultures and monocultures) separately exposed to single strains of three parasite species. When we manipulated the genetic diversity of a single parasite species and exposed them to host monocultures and polycultures, we found that parasite prevalence increased with the number of parasite strains. Host monocultures exposed to several parasite strains had higher mean parasite prevalence and higher variance than polycultures. These results indicate that effect of host genetic diversity on the spread of infection depends on the level of genetic diversity in the parasite population.

AB The pervasive impact of invasive species has motivated considerable research to understand how characteristics of invaded communities, such as native species diversity, affect the establishment of invasive species. Efforts to identify general mechanisms that limit invasion success, however, have been frustrated by disagreement between landscape-scale observations that generally find a positive relationship between native diversity and invasibility and smaller-scale experiments that consistently reveal competitive interactions that generate the opposite relationship. Here we experimentally elucidate the mechanism explaining the large-scale positive associations between invasion success and native intertidal diversity revealed in our landscape-scale surveys of New England shorelines. Experimental manipulations revealed this large-scale pattern is driven by a facilitation cascade where ecosystem-engineering species interact nonlinearly to enhance native diversity and invasion success by alleviating thermal stress and substrate instability. Our findings reveal that large-scale diversity-invasion relationships can be explained by small-scale positive interactions that commonly occur across multiple trophic levels and functional groups. We argue that facilitation has played an important but unrecognized role in the invasion of other well studied systems, and will be of increasing importance with anticipated climate change.

AB Studies simultaneously evaluating the importance of safe-site and seed limitation for plant establishment are rare, particularly in human-modified landscapes. We used spatially,explicit neighborhood models together with data from 10 0.5-ha mapped census plots in a fragmented landscape spanning 1000 km(2) to (1) evaluate the relative importance of seed production, dispersal, and safe-site limitation for the recruitment of the understory herb Heliconia acuminata; and (2) determine how these processes differ between fragments and continuous forests. Our analyses demonstrated a large degree of variation in seed production, dispersal, and establishment among and within the 10 study plots. Seed production limitation was strong but only at small spatial scales. Average dispersal distance was less than 4 m, leading to severe dispersal limitation at most sites. Overall, safe-site limitation was the most important constraint on seedling establishment. Fragmentation led to a more heterogeneous light environment with negative consequences for seedling establishment but had little effect on seed production or dispersal. These results suggest that the effects of fragmentation on abiotic processes may be more important than the disruption of biotic interactions in driving biodiversity loss in tropical forests, at least for some functional groups. These effects May be common when the matrix surrounding fragments contains enough tree cover to enable movement of dispersers and pollinators.

AB The main theories explaining the biological diversity of rain forests often confer a limited understanding of the contribution of interspecific interactions to the observed patterns. We show how two-species mutualisms can affect much larger segments of the invertebrate community in tropical rain forests. Aechmea mertensii (Bromeliaceae) is both a phytotelm (plant-held water) and an ant-garden epiphyte. We studied the influence of its. associated ant species (Pachycondyla goeldii and Camponotus femoratus) on the physical characteristics of the plants, and, subsequently, on the diversity of the invertebrate communities that inhabit their tanks. As dispersal agents for the bromeliads, P. goeldii and C. femoratus influence the shape and size of the bromeliad by determining the location of the seedling, from exposed to partially shaded areas. By coexisting on a local scale, the two ant species generate a gradient of habitat conditions in terms of available resources (space and food) for aquatic invertebrates, the diversity of the invertebrate communities increasing with greater volumes of water and fine detritus. Two-species mutualisms are widespread in nature, but their influence on the diversity of entire communities remains largely unexplored. Because macroinvertebrates constitute an important part of animal production in all ecosystem types, further investigations should address the functional implications of such indirect effects.

AB Heritable phenotypic variation in plants can be caused not only by underlying genetic differences, but also by variation in epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation. However, we still know very little about how relevant such epigenetic variation is to the ecology and evolution of natural populations. We conducted a greenhouse experiment in which we treated a set of natural genotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana with the demethylating agent 5-azacytidine and examined the consequences of this treatment for plant traits and their phenotypic plasticity. Experimental demethylation strongly reduced the growth and fitness of plants and delayed their flowering, but the degree of this response varied significantly among genotypes. Differences in genotypes' responses to demethylation were only weakly related to their genetic relatedness, which is consistent with the idea that natural epigenetic variation is independent of genetic variation. Demethylation also altered patterns of phenotypic plasticity, as well as the amount of phenotypic variation observed among plant individuals and genotype means. We have demonstrated that epigenetic variation can have a dramatic impact on ecologically important plant traits and their variability, as well as on the fitness of plants and their ecological interactions. Epigenetic variation may thus be an overlooked factor in the evolutionary ecology of plant populations.

AB Evolutionary community ecology is an emerging field of study that includes evolutionary principles such as individual trait variation and plasticity of traits to provide a more mechanistic insight as to how species diversity is maintained and community processes are shaped across time and space. In this review we explore phenotypic plasticity in functional traits and its consequences at the community level. We argue that resource requirement and resource uptake are plastic traits that can alter fundamental and realised niches of species in the community if environmental conditions change. We conceptually add to niche models by including phenotypic plasticity in traits involved in resource allocation under stress. Two qualitative predictions that we derive are: (1) plasticity in resource requirement induced by availability of resources enlarges the fundamental niche of species and causes a reduction of vacant niches for other species and (2) plasticity in the proportional resource uptake results in expansion of the realized niche, causing a reduction in the possibility for coexistence with other species. We illustrate these predictions with data on the competitive impact of invasive species. Furthermore, we review the quickly increasing number of empirical studies on evolutionary community ecology and demonstrate the impact of phenotypic plasticity on community composition. Among others, we give examples that show that differences in the level of phenotypic plasticity can disrupt species interactions when environmental conditions change, due to effects on realized niches. Finally, we indicate several promising directions for future phenotypic plasticity research in a community context. We need an integrative, trait-based approach that has its roots in community and evolutionary ecology in order to face fast changing environmental conditions such as global warming and urbanization that pose ecological as well as evolutionary challenges.

AB Question: How will global changes impact the ecological and evolutionary outcomes of competition?
   Hypothesis: Global changes that alter resource availability, such as rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations, will alter the effects of competition on mean fitness and patterns of natural selection. Because species exhibit different growth responses to elevated CO2 and because different traits may aid in competition against different taxa. these ecological and evolutionary effects may depend on the Identity of the competitor
   Organism: Arabidopsis thaliana grown under intraspecific competition or interspecific competition with the C3 grass Biomus inermis or the C4 grass Andropogon gerardu
   Field site: BioCON (Biodiversity, CO2, and Nitrogen) experiment at Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve. Minnesota, USA
   Methods: Manipulate the presence and type of competition experienced by A thaliana populations growing under ambient or elevated CO2 conditions. Measure the interactive effects of CO2 and competition on mean fitness and on patterns of natural selection
   Conclusions: Elevated CO2 reduces the effects of competition on mean fitness, alters the relative fitness effects of different competition treatments, and minimizes the strength of competition as a selective agent

AB Background: The lifetime fitness of a plant depends in part on how it responds to interspecific biotic interactions and these interactions can play major roles in shaping the evolution of many phenotypic traits The interactions between a single plant and its many herbivores may occur independently, or the direction and rate of any evolutionary change in plant defensive traits may be a result of interacting selection pressures
   Questions: Does a single genetically based defensive trait in Eucalyptus globulus confer resistance to two mammalian herbivores? Is there a genetically based correlation for resistance to browsing by alternative herbivores? Does the strength of the relationship between plant defensive chemistry and resistance to both herbivores differ across the geographic range of E globulin?
   Methods: We offered foliage from a common garden trial (from different genetic hierarchies, race, population, and family) to two herbivores and analysed plants for defensive chemistry. We examined the relationship between relative plant resistance to both herbivores and plant secondary chemistry. both across and within races of E globulus Furthermore, we examined the genetic-based correlation in preference between herbivores
   Results: Resistance to both herbivores is mediated by genetically based variation in formylated phloroglucinol compounds, particularly sideroxylonal There was a positive correlation in herbivore resistance among plant populations reared under common conditions and a correlation in resistance within races, thus the preferences and subsequent selection imposed by alternate herbivores are not independent We discuss these results in light of herbivores as possible agents of selection on plant secondary metabolites in E globulus. In addition, the relationship between chemistry and foliage susceptibility varies across the geographic range of E globulus, suggesting that the extant selection surface is not uniform within the species.

AB P>1. Population dynamics of insect host-parasitoid systems are important in many natural and managed ecosystems and have inspired much ecological theory. However, ecologists have a limited knowledge about the relative strengths of species interactions, abiotic effects and density dependence in natural host-parasitoid dynamics. Statistical time-series analyses would be more informative by incorporating multiple factors, measurement error and noisy dynamics.
   2. We use a novel maximum likelihood and model-selection analysis of a state-space model for host-parasitoid dynamics to examine 21 years of annual census data for woolly bear caterpillars (Platyprepia virginalis) and their locally host-specific tachinid parasitoids (Thelaira americana).
   3. Caterpillar densities varied by three orders of magnitude and were driven by density dependence and precipitation from the previous March but not detectably by parasitoids, despite variable and sometimes high (> 50%) parasitism.
   4. Fly fluctuations, as estimated from per cent parasitism, were affected by density dependence and precipitation from the previous July. There was marginal evidence that host abundance drives fly fluctuations as a generic linear effect but no evidence for classical Nicholson-Bailey coupling.
   5. The state-space model analysis includes new methods for likelihood calculation and allows a balanced consideration of effect magnitude and statistical significance in a nonlinear model with multiple alternative explanatory variables.

AB P>1. The stress-gradient hypothesis (SGH) predicts that the frequency of facilitative and competitive interactions will vary inversely across abiotic stress gradients, with facilitation being more common when abiotic stress is high. The effect of competition intensity on species richness is generally thought to be negative, but tests along true stress gradients are lacking. This body of research has primarily focused on vascular plants and could be well informed by broadening to other communities.
   2. We report the first regional-scale test of the SGH using biological soil crusts dominated by mosses and lichens, a key multi-functional community of arid and semi-arid ecosystems worldwide. We examined the intensity of facilitative or competitive interactions at the level of the community and among species pairs along an aridity gradient. Along this gradient we also examined the relationship between competition intensity and species richness.
   3. All evidence strongly suggested that negative species interactions are prevalent in this study system and much more common than expected by chance. At the community scale, we found that abiotic stress associated with aridity was positively related to and explained 6-56% of the variance in indicators of facilitation or competition, dependent on the index and algorithm used. Despite this intriguing contradiction of the SGH at the whole community scale, we found scant dependency of species-level interactions upon abiotic stress. However, the sign and intensity of these interactions proved to be species-specific. We also found that the relationship between competition and species richness, usually negatively affected by competition, was positively related to richness at low abiotic stress, and negatively related to richness at high abiotic stress.
   4. Synthesis. We propose that the response of species interactions to stress gradients may partially depend upon the particular modes of facilitation and competition, in addition to type of stressor and life-history strategies of species involved. We also hypothesize that because stress can act as a filter, a greater number of species interactions are possible under low stress conditions. We believe that this may render intransitivity dominant over niche segregation and expansion, potentially resulting in positive effects of competition on species richness in low stress situations.

   reproduction

AB P>1. Nitrogen (N) limits primary productivity in many systems and can have dramatic effects on plant-herbivore interactions, but its effects on mutualistic interactions at the community level are not well-understood. The reproduction of many plants depends on both soil N and pollination, and N may affect floral traits, such as flower number or size, which are important for pollinator attraction to plant individuals and communities.
   2. Thus, N may influence plant biomass and reproduction directly as well as indirectly via changes in pollination. The degree to which the effects of N enrichment scale from plant individuals to assemblages through emerging community-level changes in species interactions, like pollination, is relatively unknown.
   3. For 4 years, we tested how N addition to subalpine plant assemblages in Colorado, USA, affected primary productivity and species diversity, floral traits and plant-pollinator interactions, and components of female and male plant reproduction.
   4. At the community level, we found that high-N addition favoured the biomass and seed production of grasses, whereas low-N addition promoted forb growth, flower production and pollinator visitation. However, using a pollen supplementation experiment, we found no evidence that N addition altered patterns of pollen limitation of seed production. Pollinators distributed themselves evenly across floral resources such that per-flower visitation rate did not differ among N treatments. Thus, individual plants did not incur any extra benefit or cost from community-level changes in plant-pollinator interactions that resulted from N enrichment, and the effects of N on forb reproduction were direct.
   5. Synthesis. Understanding how mutualistic and antagonistic species interactions influence individual and community responses to abiotic resources may provide insight to the dominant forces structuring communities and is especially important in the context of predicting the effects of environmental change. In this case, the direct effects of N addition on plants were stronger than the indirect effects mediated through plant-pollinator interactions, thus supporting the concept of bottom-up resource limitation controlling plant response.

AB Many studies of interactions between exotic and native ungulates have not had temporal and spatial controls nor have they considered the types of competitive interactions that would allow coexistence. For exotic axis deer (Axis axis) and native white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) to coexist one species should be superior at interference competition and the other species should be superior at exploitative competition. We generated and tested predictions, based on body size and diet breadth, about habitat selection by white-tailed deer in the presence and absence of axis deer, dominance relationships, and time at sites provisioned with high quality forage. We conducted our study in treatment (axis and white-tailed deer) and control (white-tailed deer only) areas when both species were present and after axis deer were removed. We conducted vehicle surveys to determine habitat use of both species. At provisioned feeding sites we recorded aggressive behaviors and amount of time species spent at feeding sites alone and together. In the treatment area white-tailed deer selection for wooded habitat increased 2.1 times after axis deer were removed, whereas habitat selection by white-tailed deer was constant in the control area over the same time. At feeding sites axis deer were dominant to white-tailed deer; both species spent a significantly greater amount of time alone than at feeders together, but amount of time that individuals of each species spent at feeders did not differ. Axis deer were superior at interference competition, but white-tailed deer were not superior at exploitative competition; thus, species coexistence is unlikely. Whether white-tailed deer are negatively impacted by axis deer at spatial scales larger than our experiment probably depends on abundance of axis deer at larger spatial scales. Experiments of species interactions with temporal and spatial controls that consider types of competitive interactions increase a manager's understanding of when and how native ungulates may be negatively impacted by exotic ungulates.

AB Both habitat complexity and priority effects can influence the strength of competitive interactions; however, the independent and synergistic effects of these processes are not well understood. In Moorea, French Polynesia, we conducted a factorial field experiment to quantify the independent and combined effects of priority effects and habitat complexity on the strength of intraspecific competitive interactions among recently settled individuals of a coral reef fish (Thalassoma quinquevittatum: Labridae). Simultaneous arrival of focal individuals with competitors resulted in a 2.89-fold increase in survival relative to reefs where focal individuals arrived 5 days later than competitors (i.e., a priority effect). Increasing habitat complexity resulted in a 1.55-fold increase in survivorship when focal individuals arrived simultaneously with or before competitors. However, increasing habitat complexity did not affect the survivorship of focal individuals arriving 5 days later than competitors. Behavior observations showed that survivorship was negatively correlated with aggression. Aggression by prior residents towards focal individuals was significantly greater when focal individuals arrived 5 days later than competitors than when they arrived simultaneously. Increasing habitat complexity did not reduce aggression. Our results suggest that, when competitors arrive simultaneously, competitive interactions are weak and subordinates are not displaced from complex habitat; increasing habitat complexity increases survival by disrupting predation. Conversely, when competitors arrive at different times, aggression intensifies and increasing habitat complexity does not disrupt predation because competitive subordinates are excluded from habitat resources. This study demonstrates that the strength of competition can be context-dependent and may vary with the timing of competitive interactions and habitat complexity.

AB The distribution of interaction strengths among community members has important consequences for assembly processes and community responses to perturbations. Species deletion from communities can trigger cascading extinction events, with strong evidence from empirical and theoretical work. I examined model competitive communities, sequentially assembled using species drawn from a global pool with interaction strengths described by different distribution shapes (uniform or beta), with the same mean and variance. As community size increased, it became harder to assemble communities drawn from a uniform distribution compared to a beta distribution. The distribution of interaction values in the assembled communities differed from the shape of the initial distribution. The distribution shape and the relative abundance of the deleted species also had strong impacts on the probability of extinction cascades following primary species removal. Extinction cascades occurred in communities with a higher mean and variance of interaction strengths before the primary extinction. Those species lost had negative equilibrium densities and tended to be the least abundant, when assessed following the reorganisation that occurred after the primary and subsequent extinctions. Knowledge of the shape of the distribution of interaction strengths from real communities will allow us to make better predictions about which species are most at risk in extinction cascades under natural circumstances.

AB Brush pile creation is a common habitat management method used to attract wildlife. However, there is a paucity of data regarding effectiveness of brush pile creation and the indirect effects of brush piles on multi-species interactions. Here we document use of man-made brush piles by Texas ratsnakes (Elaphe obsoleta), examine mechanisms behind that use, and present results of a pilot study comparing avian nest success in areas with and without brush piles to determine if predator attraction to brush piles negatively affects the surrounding bird community. Radio-tracked snakes were found in brush piles 10% of the time, despite brush piles comprising less than 0.2% of the habitat by area. More abundant small mammals and more moderate temperatures in brush piles than in surrounding habitats could explain snakes' attraction to brush piles. Nest success of birds was similar in areas with and without brush piles in the year following brush pile creation. Because it may take substantially longer than 1 y for snake use to reach its maximum, however, it is premature to conclude that brush piles do not affect birds nesting in adjacent habitat. Given the apparent. prevalence of brush pile creation, and the demonstrated preference of brush piles by ratsnakes, further research to document the consequences of brush pile creation is warranted.

AB Transition zones, located at the boundaries between biogeographic regions, represent events of biotic hybridization, promoted by historical and ecological changes. They deserve special attention, because they represent areas of intense biotic interaction. In its more general sense, the Mexican Transition Zone is a complex and varied area where Neotropical and Nearctic biotas overlap, from southwestern USA to Mexico and part of Central America, extending south to the Nicaraguan lowlands. In recent years, panbiogeographic analyses have led to restriction of the Mexican Transition Zone to the montane areas of Mexico and to recognize five smaller biotic components within it. A cladistic biogeographic analysis challenged the hypothesis that this transition zone is biogeographically divided along a north-south axis at the Transmexican Volcanic Belt, as the two major clades found divided Mexico in an east-west axis. This implies that early Tertiary geological events leading to the convergence of Neotropical and Nearctic elements may be younger (Miocene) than those that led to the east-west pattern (Paleocene). The Mexican Transition Zone consists of five biogeographic provinces: Sierra Madre Occidental, Sierra Madre Oriental, Transmexican Volcanic Belt, Sierra Madre del Sur, and Chiapas. Within this transition zone, at least four cenocrons have been identified: Paleoamerican, Nearctic, Montane Mesoamerican, and Tropical Mesoamerican. Future studies should continue refining the identification of cenocrons and the reconstruction of a geobiotic scenario, as well as integrating ecological biogeographic studies, to allow a more complete understanding of the patterns and processes that have caused the biotic complexity of this transition zone.

AB Most of the Earth's biodiversity resides in the tropics. However, a comprehensive understanding of which factors control range limits of tropical species is still lacking. Climate is often thought to be the predominant range-determining mechanism at large spatial scales. Alternatively, species' ranges may be controlled by soil or other environmental factors, or by non-environmental factors such as biotic interactions, dispersal barriers, intrinsic population dynamics, or time-limited expansion from place of origin or past refugia. How species ranges are controlled is of key importance for predicting their responses to future global change. Here, we use a novel implementation of species distribution modelling (SDM) to assess the degree to which African continental-scale species distributions in a keystone tropical group, the palms (Arecaceae), are controlled by climate, non-climatic environmental factors, or non-environmental spatial constraints. A comprehensive data set on African palm species occurrences was assembled and analysed using the SDM algorithm Maxent in combination with climatic and non-climatic environmental predictors (habitat, human impact), as well as spatial eigenvector mapping (spatial filters). The best performing models always included spatial filters, suggesting that palm species distributions are always to some extent limited by non-environmental constraints. Models which included climate provided significantly better predictions than models that included only non-climatic environmental predictors, the latter having no discernible effect beyond the climatic control. Hence, at the continental scale, climate constitutes the only strong environmental control of palm species distributions in Africa. With regard to the most important climatic predictors of African palm distributions, water-related factors were most important for 25 of the 29 species analysed. The strong response of palm distributions to climate in combination with the importance of non-environmental spatial constraints suggests that African palms will be sensitive to future climate changes, but that their ability to track suitable climatic conditions will be spatially constrained.

AB Invasive plants are considered a major cause of ecosystem degradation worldwide. While their impacts on native plants have been widely reported, there is little information on how these impacts propagate through food webs and affect species at higher trophic levels. Using a quantitative food web approach we evaluated the impacts of an invasive plant on plant-herbivore-parasitoid communities, asking specifically how diet breadth influences the propagation of such impacts. Measuring the impact of the alien plant at the plant level seriously underestimated the community-level effect of this weed as it also caused changes in the abundance of native herbivores and parasitoids, along with a decrease in parasitoid species richness. The invading plant affected specialist and generalist subsets of communities differently, having significant and strong negative impacts on the abundance of all specialists with no negative effect on generalist consumers. Specialist consumer decline led to further disruptions of top-down regulatory mechanisms, releasing generalist species from competition via shared natural enemies. Plant invasion also significantly increased the evenness of species abundance of all trophic levels in the food webs, as well as the evenness of species interaction frequency. Extending impact evaluation to higher trophic levels and considering changes in trophic diversity within levels is hence essential for a full evaluation of the consequences of invasion by alien plants. Moreover, information on diet breadth of species in the invaded community should be taken into account when evaluating/predicting the impacts on any introduced species.

AB Ecological processes of low-productivity ecosystems have long been considered to be driven by abiotic controls with biotic interactions playing an insignificant role. However, existing studies present conflicting evidence concerning the roles of these factors, in part due to the short temporal extent of most data sets and inability to test indirect effects of environmental variables modulated by biotic interactions. Using structural equation modeling to analyze 65 years of perennial vegetation change in the Sonoran Desert, we found that precipitation had a stronger positive effect on recruitment beneath existing canopies than in open microsites due to reduced evaporation rates. Variation in perennial canopy cover had additional facilitative effects on juvenile recruitment, which was indirectly driven by effects of density and precipitation on cover. Mortality was strongly influenced by competition as indicated by negative density-dependence, whereas precipitation had no effect. The combined direct, indirect, and interactive facilitative effects of precipitation and cover on recruitment were substantial, as was the effect of competition on mortality, providing strong evidence for dual control of community dynamics by climate and biotic interactions. Through an empirically derived simulation model, we also found that the positive feedback of density on cover produces unique temporal abundance patterns, buffering changes in abundance from high frequency variation in precipitation, amplifying effects of low frequency variation, and decoupling community abundance from precipitation patterns at high abundance. Such dynamics should be generally applicable to low-productivity systems in which facilitation is important and can only be understood within the context of long-term variation in climatic patterns. This predictive model can be applied to better manage low-productivity ecosystems, in which variation in biogeochemical processes and trophic dynamics may be driven by positive density-dependent feedbacks that influence temporal abundance and productivity patterns.

AB P>A species may overlap with a mosaic of species across its geographic range. Many types of species interaction cause selection on mating traits, but their role in generating within-species divergence has been neglected. The pattern of reproductive character displacement (RCD) has been classically attributed to reinforcement, a process driven by selection against hybridisation. Recent reinforcement research shows that sexual isolation can result between displaced and non-displaced populations. We argue that RCD (and hence potentially speciation) among populations can be generated by a variety of fundamental species interactions beyond reinforcement. We unify these interactions under one process of mating trait divergence and speciation ('RCD speciation'). This process can occur in many geographic settings. Because selection is acting directly on mating traits, rapid speciation can result involving little differentiation in other traits. This pattern of diversification is seen in many groups and regions, and has previously been attributed to sexual selection alone.

AB P>The global biodiversity crisis has made a priority of understanding biodiversity maintenance in ecological communities. It is increasingly apparent that dispersal patterns can have important effects on such maintenance processes. Nevertheless, most competition theory has focused on a small subset of the possible dispersal patterns in nature. Here, we show that spatially asymmetric dispersal, i.e. the disproportionate transport of propagules towards or away from particular habitat patches in a metacommunity, when it differs between species, can promote the coexistence of competing species even in the absence of environmental heterogeneity among habitat patches. Moreover, when asymmetric dispersal is present, changes in the self-recruitment of competitive dominants and subordinates have important, but fundamentally different, effects on species coexistence. Our results underscore the importance of the interplay between species interactions and dispersal patterns for understanding the effects of habitat fragmentation and for designing regional-scale conservation strategies, such as networks of protected areas.

AB P>1. Plants use a range of sophisticated strategies to protect themselves against herbivores and pathogens, such as the production of jasmonates, a group of plant hormones that prime the plant's defense system upon attack. However, defense-related mechanisms, such as the jasmonate response, play a more diverse role than previously appreciated. Jasmonates also regulate key mutualist relationships, leading to a suit of potential conflicting selection pressures as a single response is employed to mediate multiple species interactions.
   2. Here, we experimentally manipulate the host's jasmonate response and document the impact on two key plant mutualisms: (i) changes to arbuscular mycorrhizal symbionts belowground (ii) modifications to floral traits affecting pollinator mutualists aboveground. By exogenously applying a range of methyl jasmonate solutions to cucumber plant roots grown with and without mycorrhizal fungi, we are able to examine the potential costs of the jasmonate response to both above and belowground mutualists.
   3. We demonstrate that the negative effect of jasmonates on floral traits depends on whether the plant is mycorrhizal or nonmycorrhizal. Mycorrhization had a positive effect on floral traits, but benefits were lost with jasmonate application. While low levels of jasmonate decreased floral traits, these same jasmonate levels increased colonization by the mycorrhizal symbiont three-fold, but only under high phosphorus conditions.
   4. Our results highlight potential conflicts for the host in the regulation of their mutualists under different conditions and suggest that the overall impact of the jasmonate response depends on the plant mycorrhizal status and its nutrient context.
   5. These findings suggest that increasing the jasmonate response may lead to differential costs and benefits for plants and their mutualists, and highlight potential conflict in planta, with mycorrhizal symbionts benefiting from intermediate levels of jasmonates while certain floral traits can be depressed at this same level.

AB Climate change is altering the rate and distribution of primary production in the world's oceans. Primary production is critical to maintaining biodiversity and supporting fishery catches, but predicting the response of populations to primary production change is complicated by predation and competition interactions. We simulated the effects of change in primary production on diverse marine ecosystems across a wide latitudinal range in Australia using the marine food web model Ecosim. We link models of primary production of lower trophic levels (phytoplankton and benthic producers) under climate change with Ecosim to predict changes in fishery catch, fishery value, biomass of animals of conservation interest, and indicators of community composition. Under a plausible climate change scenario, primary production will increase around Australia and generally this benefits fisheries catch and value and leads to increased biomass of threatened marine animals such as turtles and sharks. However, community composition is not strongly affected. Sensitivity analyses indicate overall positive linear responses of functional groups to primary production change. Responses are robust to the ecosystem type and the complexity of the model used. However, model formulations with more complex predation and competition interactions can reverse the expected responses for some species, resulting in catch declines for some fished species and localized declines of turtle and marine mammal populations under primary productivity increases. We conclude that climate-driven primary production change needs to be considered by marine ecosystem managers and more specifically, that production increases can simultaneously benefit fisheries and conservation. Greater focus on incorporating predation and competition interactions into models will significantly improve the ability to identify species and industries most at risk from climate change.

AB Although body size can affect individual fitness, ontogenetic and spatial variation in the ecology of an organism may determine the relative advantages of size and growth. During an 8-year field study in the Bahamas, we examined selective mortality on size and growth throughout the entire reef-associated life phase of a common coral-reef fish, Stegastes partitus (the bicolour damselfish). On average, faster-growing juveniles experienced greater mortality, though as adults, larger individuals had higher survival. Comparing patterns of selection observed at four separate populations revealed that greater population density was associated with stronger selection for larger adult size. Large adults may be favoured because they are superior competitors and less susceptible to gape-limited predators. Laboratory experiments suggested that selective mortality of fast-growing juveniles was likely because of risk-prone foraging behaviour. These patterns suggest that variation in ecological interactions may lead to complex patterns of lifetime selection on body size.

AB Whereas sexual reproduction may facilitate adaptation to complex environments with many biotic interactions, simplified environments are expected to favour asexual reproduction. In agreement with this, recent studies on invertebrates have shown a prevalence of asexual species in agricultural (simplified) but not in natural (complex) environments. We investigated whether the same correlation between reproductive mode and habitat can be found in different populations within one species. The parasitoid wasp Tetrastichus coeruleus forms an ideal model to test this question, since it occurs both in natural and agricultural environments. Further, we investigated whether Wolbachia infection caused parthenogenesis in female-biased populations. In contrast to the general pattern, in Dutch and French natural areas, we found Wolbachia-infected, highly female-biased populations that reproduce parthenogenetically. In contrast, populations on Dutch agricultural fields were not infected with Wolbachia, showed higher frequencies of males and reproduced sexually. However, we also found a female-only, Wolbachia-infected population on agricultural fields in north-eastern United States. All Wolbachia-infected populations were infected with the same Wolbachia strain. At this moment, we do not have a convincing explanation for this deviation from the general pattern of ecology and reproductive mode. It may be that asparagus agricultural fields differ from other crop fields in ways that favour sexual reproduction. Alternatively, Wolbachia may manipulate life history traits in its host, resulting in different fitness pay-offs in different habitats. The fixation of Wolbachia in the United States populations (where the species was introduced) may be due to founder effect and lack of uninfected, sexual source populations.

AB Many related species share the same environment and utilize similar resources. This is surprising because based on the principle of competitive exclusion one would predict that the superior competitor would drive the other species to extinction; coexistence is only predicted if interspecific competition is weaker than intraspecific competition. Interspecific competition is frequently reduced by differential resource use, resulting in habitat segregation. In this paper, we use the closely related collared and pied flycatcher to assess the potential of habitat differences to affect interspecific competition through a different mechanism, namely by generating temporal differences in availability of similar food resources between the two species. We found that the tree species composition of the breeding territories of the two species differed, mainly by a higher abundance of coniferous species around nest-boxes occupied by pied flycatchers. The temporal availability of caterpillars was measured using frass traps under four deciduous and two coniferous tree species. Deciduous tree species showed an early and narrow peak in abundance, which contrasted with the steady increase in caterpillar abundance in the coniferous tree species through the season. We subsequently calculated the predicted total caterpillar biomass available in each flycatcher territory. This differed between the species, with biomass decreasing more slowly in pied flycatcher territories. Caterpillar biomass is strongly correlated with the reproductive success of collared flycatchers, but much less so with pied flycatchers. However, caterpillar availability can only partly explain the differences in seasonal decline of reproductive success between the two species; we discuss additional factors that may contribute to this species difference. Overall, our results are consistent with the suggestion that minor habitat differences between these two species may contribute to promoting their coexistence.

AB Spatial heterogeneity in the selection imposed by different predator species could promote the adaptive diversification of local prey populations. However, high gene flow might swamp local adaptations at limited spatial scales or generalized phenotypic plasticity might evolve in place of local diversification. Spotted salamander larvae Ambystoma maculatum face strongly varying risks from gape-limited marbled salamander larvae Ambystoma opacum and gape-unconstrained diving beetle larvae Dytiscus spp. across natural landscapes. To evaluate if A. maculatum adapts to these predation risk across micro-geographic scales, I measured selection gradients in response to the two focal predators and then assayed the defensive morphologies of ten populations in a common garden experiment. I found that A. opacum induced selection on A. maculatum for larger tailfins and bodies whereas beetles induced selection for larger tail muscles and smaller bodies. In accordance with the local adaptation hypothesis, A. maculatum populations inhabiting ponds with high beetle densities grew larger tail muscles relative to other populations when raised in a common environment. However, populations exposed to strong A. opacum selection did not evolve larger tailfins as predicted. High gene flow or morphological plasticity could explain the absence of this morphological response to A. opacum. Overall, results suggest that populations can sometimes evolve adaptive traits in response to locally variable selection regimes even across the very limited distances that separate populations in this study. If prey populations often differ in their defenses against local predators, then this variation could affect the outcome of species interactions in local communities.

AB We conducted reciprocal transplant experiments with four dominant species from salt and tidal freshwater marshes at two tidal elevations. Ten individuals of each species were transplanted as sods to the opposing marsh type and within their native marsh (two sites each). Transplants were placed at the centre of 9-m2 plots along a line parallel to the river bank. In order to disentangle abiotic and biotic influences, we set up plots with and without neighbouring vegetation, resulting in five replicates per site.
   Freshwater species (Bolboschoenus maritimus and Phragmites australis) transplanted to salt marshes performed poorly regardless of whether neighbouring vegetation was present or not, although 50-70% of the transplants did survive. Growth of Phragmites transplants was impaired also by competition in freshwater marshes. Salt marsh species (Spartina anglica and Puccinellia maritima) had extremely low biomass when transplanted to freshwater marshes and 80-100% died in the presence of neighbours. Without neighbours, biomass of salt marsh species in freshwater marshes was similar to or higher than that in salt marshes.
   Our results indicate that salt marsh species are precluded from freshwater marshes by competition, whereas freshwater species are excluded from salt marshes by physical stress. Thus, our study provides the first experimental evidence from a European estuary for the general theory that species boundaries along environmental gradients are determined by physical factors towards the harsh end and by competitive ability towards the benign end of the gradient. We generally found no significant impact of competition in salt marshes, indicating a shift in the importance of competition along the estuarine gradient.

AB Positive interactions are widely recognized as playing a major role in the organization of community structure and diversity. As such, recent theoretical and empirical works have revealed the significant contribution of positive interactions in shaping species' geographical distributions, particularly in harsh abiotic conditions. in this report, we explore the joint influence of local dispersal and an environmental gradient on the spatial distribution, structure and function of communities containing positive interactions. While most previous theoretical efforts were limited to modelling the dynamics of single pairs of associated species being mutualist or competitor, here we employ a spatially explicit multi-species metacommunity model covering a rich range of interspecific interactions (mutualism, competition and exploitation) along an environmental gradient. We find that mutualistic interactions dominate in communities with low diversity characterized by limited species dispersal and poor habitat quality. On the other hand, the fraction of mutualistic interactions decreases at the expense of exploitation and competition with the increase in diversity caused by higher dispersal and/or habitat quality. Our multi-species model exemplifies the ubiquitous presence of mutualistic interactions and the role of mutualistic species as facilitators for the further establishment of species during ecosystem assembly. We therefore argue that mutualism is an essential component driving the origination of complex and diverse communities. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Functional agrodiversity can be useful and even essential for, i.e., the long-term sustainability of agriculture. However, still many aspects of this concept are not well understood. The interplay between species in diverse agro-ecosystems is based on processes as, i.e., competition, facilitation, and predator-prey relations. The net-effect of these processes on crop growth is not static and can change over time as the relative density of species change. The equilibrium state of a diverse agro-ecosystem might be far from optimum or even unproductive. This makes agrodiveristy a concept which is not easily grasped nor obtained or maintained. We believe that an agent-based model can facilitate learning on the topic of functional agrodiversity. In this paper, we present the agent-based simulation model. Agrodiversity, v.2, developed in Netlogo 3.1.5. The model simulates a virtual diverse agro-ecosystem with four ecological agents. The user is challenged to explore ecological parameters and design a productive sustainable system. The model's "simplest playing level" shows that a proper balance between the co-existing species is necessary so that their ecological interactions allow the multi-species system to become self-organized and persist over time. It demonstrates the transient nature of profitable functional agrodiversity. Our analysis on the effects of using Agrodiversity v.2 on actual learning shows that the learning took place. Students increased the quality of their answers to paper-based individual questions on the topic from 29% during passive/conceptual teaching to 86% after the simulation session. On average students stated to have learnt 55% of their current knowledge through the workshop of which 76% was learnt by using the simulation. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Chronic social stress diverts energy away from growth, reproduction and immunity, and is thus a potential driver of population dynamics. However, the effects of social stress on demographic density dependence remain largely overlooked in ecological theory. Here we combine behavioural experiments, physiology and population modelling to show in a top predator (pike Esox lucius) that social stress alone may be a primary driver of demographic density dependence. Doubling pike density in experimental ponds under controlled prey availability did not significantly change prey intake by pike (i.e. did not significantly change interference or exploitative competition), but induced a neuroendocrine stress response reflecting a size-dependent dominance hierarchy, depressed pike energetic status and lowered pike body growth rate by 23 per cent. Assuming fixed size-dependent survival and fecundity functions parameterized for the Windermere (UK) pike population, stress-induced smaller body size shifts age-specific survival rates and lowers age-specific fecundity, which in Leslie matrices projects into reduced population rate of increase (lambda) by 37-56%. Our models also predict that social stress flattens elasticity profiles of lambda to age-specific survival and fecundity, thus making population persistence more dependent on old individuals. Our results suggest that accounting for non-consumptive social stress from competitors and predators is necessary to accurately understand, predict and manage food-web dynamics.

AB It is widely accepted that exotic invasive species are one of the most important ecological and economic problems. Reproductive and establishment traits are considered key features of a population expansion process, but few works have studied many of these simultaneously. This work examines how large the differences are in reproductive and establishment traits between two Fabaceae, the exotic invasive, Gleditsia triacanthos and the native, Acacia aroma. Gleditsia is a serious leguminous woody invader in various parts of the world and Acacia is a common native tree of Argentina. Both species have similar dispersal mechanisms and their reproductive phenology overlaps. We chose 17 plants of each species in a continuous forest of the Chaco Serrano Forest of Cordoba, Argentina. In each plant we measured fruit production, fruit removal (exclusion experiments), seed predation (pre- and post-dispersal), seed germination, seed bank (on each focal tree, three sampling periods during the year), and density of seedlings (around focal individuals and randomly in the study site). Gleditsia presented some traits that could favour the invasion process, such as a higher number of seeds per plant, percentage of scarified seed germination and density of seedlings around the focal individuals, than Acacia. On the other hand, Gleditsia presented a higher percentage of seed predation. The seed bank was persistent in both species and no differences were observed in fruit removal. This work highlights the importance of simultaneously studying reproductive and establishment variables involved in the spreading of an exotic invasive species. It also gives important insight into the variables to be considered when planning management strategies. The results are discussed from the perspective of some remarkable hypotheses on invasive species and may contribute to rethinking some aspects of the theory on invasive species.

AB Zooplankton abundance was related to hydrological and environmental variables in a hydrologically dynamic lake fed by a pseudokarstic aquifer. The study period (2002-2006) in Lake Tovel covered different hydrological situations with water residence time (WRT) having the lowest values in 2002 and the highest values in 2003. WRT was negatively correlated with silica concentrations and algal biovolume. Furthermore, the biovolume of small algae was highest in spring and summer, while large algae did not show any pattern. In multivariate analysis, high abundance of crustacean species in autumn and winter was positively related to WRT and negatively to algal biovolume, while high abundance of rotifer species in spring and summer was negatively related to WRT and positively to algal biovolume. With the exception of Keratella cochlearis and Gastropus stylifer, rotifers showed a pattern of crustacean avoidance, and three groups were distinguished: (i) Ascomorpha ecaudis and Polyarthra dolichoptera, (ii) Asplanchna priodonta and Synchaeta spp., and (iii) Filinia terminalis and Keratella quadrata. These groups were associated with different food sources and depths. We suggest that WRT influenced the rotifer-crustacean relationship by wash-out effects and competition for food resources. The dynamics of single rotifer species were attributable to specific feeding requirements and adaptations. In summary, WRT determined the platform for abiotic and biotic interactions that influenced population dynamics of crustaceans and rotifers.

AB Road deicing agents can enter nearby wetlands and alter the composition of aquatic communities by directly eliminating salt-intolerant species and modifying ecological interactions between tolerant species. We conducted field experiments to examine the sensitivity of taxa that inhabit seasonal wetlands and to determine whether salt contamination could increase the production of ovipositing insects. In two outdoor mesocosm experiments, cladocerans and copepods rarely survived concentrations of commercial road salt > 1,200 mg L-1, while wood frog eggs and hatchlings (Lithobates sylvaticus) were not strongly impacted until concentrations exceeded 4,500 mg L-1. Shore flies (Ephydridae), mosquitoes (Culex restuans; Anopheles punctipennis) and midge larvae (Chironomidae) were more salt tolerant than macrozooplankton. These taxa tended to be absent or relatively rare in experimental mesocosms with low salinities, but abundant in mesocosms with intermediate to high salinities. We conducted two additional experiments to examine whether adult choice of oviposition sites may in part explain the rarity of Cx. restuans in pools with low salinity. These revealed that Cx. restuans reduced oviposition rates in water-filled containers with cladocerans, and reduced clutch size in the presence of Lithobates larvae. However, salt concentration per se did not influence the propensity of Cx. restuans to oviposit. Collectively, our results suggest that aquatic habitats that are biologically compromised by deicing agents favor salt-tolerant insects, and that the use of road salts could increase the production of adult mosquitoes that are pests and vectors of disease.

AB The sub-discipline of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF) has emerged as a central topic in contemporary ecological research. However, to date no study has evaluated the prominence and publication biases in BEF research. Herein we report the results of a careful quantitative assessment of BEF research published in five core general ecology journals from 1990 to 2007 to determine the position of BEF research within ecology, identify patterns of research effort within BEF research, and discuss their probable proximal and historical causes. The relative importance of BEF publications increased exponentially during the period analyzed and was significantly greater than the average growth of ecological literature, affirming the prominence of BEF as a current paradigm in ecology. However, BEF research exhibited a strong bias toward experimental studies on terrestrial plant communities, with significantly lower effort devoted to the functional aspects of biodiversity in aquatic systems, multiple trophic level systems, and animal or microbial communities. Such trends may be explained by a combination of methodological adequacy and historic epistemological differences in ecological thinking. We suggest that BEF researchers should direct more effort toward the study of aquatic systems and animal communities, emphasize long-term and trophically complex experiments, such as those with multi-trophic microbial communities, employ larger-scale field observational studies and increase the use of integrative and theoretical studies. Many technical and analytical methodologies that are already employed in ecological research, such as stable isotopes, paleobiology, remote sensing, and model selection criteria, can facilitate these aims. Overcoming the above-mentioned shortcomings of current BEF research will greatly improve our ability to predict how biodiversity loss will affect ecosystem processes and services in natural ecosystems.

AB Ecological niche modeling (ENM) has become an important tool in conservation biology. Despite its recent success, several basic issues related to algorithm performance are still being debated. We assess the ability of two of the most popular algorithms, GARP and Maxent, to predict distributions when sampling is geographically biased. We use an extensive data set collected in the Brazilian Cerrado, a biodiversity hotspot in South America. We found that both algorithms give richness predictions that are very similar to other traditionally used richness estimators. Also, both algorithms correctly predicted the presence of most species collected during fieldwork, and failed to predict species collected only in very few cases (usually species with very few known localities, i.e., < 5). We also found that Maxent tends to be more sensitive to sampling bias than GARP. However, Maxent performs better when sampling is poor (e.g., low number of data points). Our results indicates that ENM, even when provided with limited and geographically biased localities, is a very useful technique to estimate richness and composition of unsampled areas. We conclude that data generated by ENM maximize the utility of existing biodiversity data, providing a very useful first evaluation. However, for reliable conservation decisions ENM data must be followed by well-designed field inventories, especially for the detection of restricted range, rare species.

AB Studies of the effects and population dynamics of invasive species typically cover only short time periods. However, populations of invasive species interact with native species, and these interactions may have strong effects on invaders' populations and effects over time. We present and analyze long-term data on invasive American mink (Neovison vison), native red fox (Vulpes vulpes), and mountain hare (Lepus timidus) in Sweden. The mink's population dynamics followed a pattern of logistic growth from the late 1930s to the late 1970s. In the early 1980s, however, the population tripled, then declined sharply. We suggest that the mink's population tripling was caused by a drastic decline in red fox populations, which caused terrestrial prey to increase. Later recovery of the fox population reversed the trend and caused the mink population's recent decline. Our study shows that species interactions between native and invasive species, and therefore biotic resistance, can change dramatically over time.

AB This paper addresses effects of trophic complexity on basal species, in a Lotka-Volterra model with stochasticity. We use simple food web modules, with three trophic levels, and expose every species to random environmental stochasticity and analyze (1) the effect of the position of strong trophic interactions on temporal fluctuations in basal species' abundances and (2) the relationship between fluctuation patterns and extinction risk. First, the numerical simulations showed that basal species do not simply track the environment, i.e. species dynamics do not simply mirror the characteristics of the applied environmental stochasticity. Second, the extinction risk of species was related to the fluctuation patterns of the species.
   More specifically, we show (i) that despite being forced by random stochasticity without temporal autocorrelation (i.e. white noise), there is significant temporal autocorrelation in the time series of all basal species' abundances (i.e. the spectra of basal species are red-shifted), (ii) the degree of temporal autocorrelation in basal species time series is affected by food web structure and (iii) the degree of temporal autocorrelation tend to be correlated to the extinction risks of basal species.
   Our results emphasize the role of food web structure and species interactions in modifying the response of species to environmental variability. To shed some light on the mechanisms we compare the observed pattern in abundances of basal species with analytically predicted patterns and show that the change in the predicted pattern due to the addition of strong trophic interactions is correlated to the extinction risk of the basal species. We conclude that much remain to be understood about the mechanisms behind the interaction among environmental variability, species interactions, population dynamics and vulnerability before we quantitatively can predict, for example, effects of climate change on species and ecological communities. Here, however, we point out a new possible approach for identifying species that are vulnerable to environmental stochasticity by checking the degree of temporal autocorrelation in the time series of species. Increased autocorrelation in population fluctuations can be an indication of increased extinction risk. (C) 2009 Elsevier BM. All rights reserved.

AB Physical conditions and biotic interactions are believed to be the determinants of plant zonation in saltmarshes. However, in rapidly developing estuarine marshes, succession is regarded as the primary process responsible for plant zonation and it is controlled mainly by environmental factors. Salinity and inundation are two important factors responsible for the distribution pattern of dominant plants in coastal saltmarshes. Here we conducted a common garden experiment as well as a field transplanting to examine the responses of four dominant saltmarsh plants (native Scirpus mariqueter, Scirpus triqueter and Phragmites australis, and exotic Spartina alterniflora) in the Yangtze River estuary to environmental gradients, which may help us understand their current and potential zonation. The results showed that Scirpus adapted to freshwater and less inundated habitats, Phragmites performed well in brackish or freshwater environments with less inundation, and Spartina tolerated the highest salinity and deepest inundation. In the harshest environments (the highest salinity and water level), only Spartina performed well. In the mild environments, however, there were only minor differences in the performances among the four species. The potential ranges of Phragmites and Spartina were predicted to be larger than their current ones, and their lower boundaries might be set by tidal scour rather than edaphic factors. With the saltmarsh succession, invasive Spartina in the Yangtze River estuary might ultimately replace Scirpus, and alter the zonal patterns of native saltmarsh plants, which will lead to severe ecosystem consequences. Thus, proper management measures (e.g., repeated mowing) need to be implemented to control this invasive exotic plant, and restore the vulnerable ecosystems invaded by Spartina in the Yangtze River estuary.

AB Both habitat patch size and structure affect the abundance and occurrence of species and thereby can affect the ecology and evolution of species interactions. Here we contrast the level of seed predation and selection exerted by Common Crossbills (Loxia curvirostra complex) and red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris) in the extensive mountain pine (Paws uncinata) forests in the Pyrenees with their level of seed predation in two small, isolated forests. Crossbills consumed 5.1 times more seeds in the Pyrenees than in the isolated forests, and six of seven cone traits under selection by crossbills were enhanced in the Pyrenees. In contrast, red squirrels tend to be uncommon in the open mountain pine forests, consuming relatively few seeds in both regions and having limited impact on both mountain pine and the interaction between crossbills and mountain pine. Resident crossbills in mountain pine forests in the Pyrenees have larger bills than in nearby forests, consistent with local adaptation by crossbills and a coevolutionary arms race between crossbills and mountain pine. The mechanisms leading to variation in the interaction between crossbills and mountain pine should be general to many systems because habitat patch size and structure often vary across the range of a species.

AB P>Rare species are assumed to have little impact on community interactions and ecosystem processes. However, very few studies have actually attempted to quantify the role of rare species in ecosystems. Here we compare effects of soil community assemblages on plant-herbivore interactions and show that reduction of rare soil microbes increases both plant biomass and plant nutritional quality. Two crop plant species growing in soil where rare microbes were reduced, had tissues of higher nutritional quality, which theoretically makes them more susceptible to pest organisms such as shoot-feeding aphids and root-feeding nematodes. Reduction of rare microbes increased aphid body size in the absence of nematodes; nematodes always reduced aphid body size independent of the soil microbial community. This study is the first to show that rare soil microbes are not redundant but may play a role in crop protection by enhancing aboveground and belowground plant defence. It remains to be tested whether these are direct effects of rare soil microbes on plants and herbivores, or indirect effects via shifts in the microbial soil community assemblages.

AB Habitat features influence the ecological interactions and spatial distribution of fish species. For example, water transparency and macrophyte cover, as well as their interaction, can strongly influence predation risk and mortality. Tethering trials were conducted in Lake St. Pierre (Quebec, Canada) to assess the effects of water transparency and macrophyte cover on the mortality risk of eight abundant fish species; Brown Bullhead (Ameiurus nebulosus), Mooneye (Hiodon tergisus), Emerald Shiner (Notropis atherinoides), Golden Shiner (Notropis crysoleucas), Blacknose Shiner (Notropis heterolepis), Spottail Shiner (Notropis hudsonius), Trout-perch (Percopsis omiscomaycus), and Yellow Perch (Perca flavescens). Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that mortality risk varied substantially among three groups of species having high, intermediate, or low survival rates. Species with spines appeared to have higher survival rates, consistent with the notion that spines deter predators. Cox regression models showed that mortality risk for six of the eight species was influenced by water transparency or an interaction of transparency with macrophyte cover. Mortality risk was generally greatest at low transparency. Variation in water transparency may generate spatial heterogeneity in fish abundance, either through direct effects, such as local reduction in prey numbers by predation, or indirect effects, such as behavioural avoidance of risky areas by prey.

AB To improve our mechanistic understanding and predictive capacities with respect to climate change effects on the spring phytoplankton bloom in temperate marine systems, we used a process-driven dynamical model to disentangle the impact of potentially relevant factors which are often correlated in the field. The model was based on comprehensive indoor mesocosm experiments run at four temperature and three light regimes. It was driven by time-series of water temperature and irradiance, considered edible and less edible phytoplankton separately, and accounted for density-dependent grazing losses. It successfully reproduced the observed dynamics of well edible phytoplankton in the different temperature and light treatments. Four major factors influenced spring phytoplankton dynamics: temperature, light (cloudiness), grazing, and the success of overwintering phyto- and zooplankton providing the starting biomasses for spring growth. Our study predicts that increasing cloudiness as anticipated for warmer winters for the Baltic Sea region will retard phytoplankton net growth and reduce peak heights. Light had a strong direct effect in contrast to temperature. However, edible phytoplankton was indirectly strongly temperature-sensitive via grazing which was already important in early spring at moderately high algal biomasses and counter-intuitively provoked lower and later algal peaks at higher temperatures. Initial phyto- and zooplankton composition and biomass also had a strong effect on spring algal dynamics indicating a memory effect via the broadly under-sampled overwintering plankton community. Unexpectedly, increased initial phytoplankton biomass did not necessarily lead to earlier or higher spring blooms since the effect was counteracted by subsequently enhanced grazing. Increasing temperature will likely exhibit complex indirect effects via changes in overwintering phytoplankton and grazer biomasses and current grazing pressure. Additionally, effects on the phytoplankton composition due to the species-specific susceptibility to grazing are expected. Hence, we need to consider not only direct but also indirect effects, e.g. biotic interactions, when addressing climate change impacts.

AB Aim
   Models relating species distributions to climate or habitat are widely used to predict the effects of global change on biodiversity. Most such approaches assume that climate governs coarse-scale species ranges, whereas habitat limits fine-scale distributions. We tested the influence of topoclimate and land cover on butterfly distributions and abundance in a mountain range, where climate may vary as markedly at a fine scale as land cover.
   Location
   Sierra de Guadarrama (Spain, southern Europe)
   Methods
   We sampled the butterfly fauna of 180 locations (89 in 2004, 91 in 2005) in a 10,800 km2 region, and derived generalized linear models (GLMs) for species occurrence and abundance based on topoclimatic (elevation and insolation) or habitat (land cover, geology and hydrology) variables sampled at 100-m resolution using GIS. Models for each year were tested against independent data from the alternate year, using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) (distribution) or Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (r(s)) (abundance).
   Results
   In independent model tests, 74% of occurrence models achieved AUCs of > 0.7, and 85% of abundance models were significantly related to observed abundance. Topoclimatic models outperformed models based purely on land cover in 72% of occurrence models and 66% of abundance models. Including both types of variables often explained most variation in model calibration, but did not significantly improve model cross-validation relative to topoclimatic models. Hierarchical partitioning analysis confirmed the overriding effect of topoclimatic factors on species distributions, with the exception of several species for which the importance of land cover was confirmed.
   Main conclusions
   Topoclimatic factors may dominate fine-resolution species distributions in mountain ranges where climate conditions vary markedly over short distances and large areas of natural habitat remain. Climate change is likely to be a key driver of species distributions in such systems and could have important effects on biodiversity. However, continued habitat protection may be vital to facilitate range shifts in response to climate change.

AB P>1. The size individuals attain reflects complex interactions between food availability and quality, environmental conditions and ecological interactions. A statistical interaction between temperature and the density of conspecifics is expected to arise from various ecological dynamics, including bioenergetic constraints, if population density affects mean consumption rate or activity level. Density effects on behaviour or size-selective predation could also generate this pattern. This interaction plays an important role in bioenergetic models, in particular, and yet has not been documented in natural populations.
   2. The lengths of 131 286 juvenile wild Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) across 13 populations spread throughout the Salmon River Basin, Idaho, USA over 15 years were compared to test whether juvenile density alters the relationship between body size and temperature.
   3. Strong evidence for a negative interaction between mean summer temperature and density emerged, despite the relatively cool temperatures in this high elevation habitat. Growth correlated positively with temperature at lower densities, but the correlation was negative at the highest densities.
   4. This is the first study to document this interaction at such a large spatial and temporal scale, and suggests that warmer temperatures might intensify some density-dependent processes. How climate change will affect individual growth rates in these populations will depend intimately on ecological conditions, particularly food availability and population dynamics. More broadly, the conditions that led to the interactions observed in our study - limited food availability and temperatures that ranged above those optimal for growth - likely exist for many other natural populations, and warrant broader exploration.

AB Aim Geographic body size patterns of mammals and birds can be partly understood under the framework of Bergmann's rule. Climatic influences on body size of invertebrates, however, appear highly variable and lack a comparable, generally applicable theoretical framework. We derived predictions for body size-climate relationships for spiders from the literature and tested them using three datasets of variable spatial extent and grain.
   Location Europe.
   Methods To distinguish climate from space, we compared clines in body size within three datasets with different degrees of co-variation between latitude and climate. These datasets were: (1) regional spider faunas from 40 European countries and large islands; (2) local spider assemblages from standardized samples in 32 habitats across Europe; and (3) local spider assemblages from Central European habitats. In the latter dataset climatic conditions were determined more by habitat type than by geographic position, and therefore this dataset provided a non-spatial gradient of various microclimates. Spider body size was studied in relation to latitude, temperature and water availability.
   Results In all three datasets the mean body size of spider assemblages increased from cool/moist to warm/dry environments. This increase could be accounted for by turnover from small-bodied to large-bodied spider families. Body size-climate relationships within families were inconsistent.
   Main conclusions Starvation resistance and accelerated maturation can be ruled out as explanations for the body size clines recorded, because they predict the inverse of the observed relationship between spider body size and temperature. The relationship between body size and climate was partly independent of geographic position. Thus, the restriction of large-bodied spiders to their glacial refugia owing to dispersal limitations can be excluded. Our results are consistent with mechanisms invoking metabolic rate, desiccation resistance and community interactions to predict a decrease in body size from warm and dry to cool and moist conditions.

AB 1. Our aim was to explore plant-soil feedback in mixed grassland communities and its significance for plant productivity and community composition relative to abiotic factors of soil type and fertility.
   2. We carried out a 4-year, field-based mesocosm experiment to determine the relative effects of soil type, historic management intensity and soil conditioning by a wide range of plant species of mesotrophic grassland on the productivity and evenness of subsequent mixed communities.
   3. The study consisted of an initial soil conditioning phase, whereby soil from two locations each with two levels of management intensity was conditioned with monocultures of nine grassland species, and a subsequent feedback phase, where mixed communities of the nine species were grown in conditioned soil to determine relative effects of experimental factors on the productivity and evenness of mixed communities and individual plant species performance.
   4. In the conditioning phase of the experiment, individual plant species differentially influenced soil microbial communities and nutrient availability. However, these biotic effects were much less important as drivers of soil microbial properties and nutrient availability than were abiotic factors of soil type and fertility.
   5. Significant feedback effects of conditioning were detected during the second phase of the study in terms of individual plant growth in mixed communities. These feedback effects were generally independent of soil type or fertility, and were consistently negative in nature. In most cases, individual plant species performed less well in mixed communities planted in soil that had previously supported their own species.
   6. Synthesis. These findings suggest that despite soil abiotic factors acting as major drivers of soil microbial communities and nutrient availability, biotic interactions in the form of negative feedback play a significant role in regulating individual plant performance in mixed grassland communities across a range of soil conditions.

   mussel Perna perna: An experimental field test of bottom-up control at

AB Top-down effects on intertidal communities concern species interactions such as competition and predation, and occur on small-scales. In contrast, bottom-up factors concern the supply of resources such as food and recruits. These are generally understood to be large-scale effects that are oceanographically controlled. Here we examined the effects of small-scale bottom-up factors on the growth of intertidal mussels to test the hypothesis that such factors can also operate on small (cm m) spatial scales. L-shaped aluminium baffles were used to reduce flow around mussels on very small (cm) scales in before/after experiments run at different sites in 2004 and 2006. Each experiment had two phases, each phase lasting approximately 100 days. At the start of phase one, mussels were individually marked at the growing edge of the shell in 10 control and 10 treatment patches before applying the treatment. At the start of phase 2, the same individuals were marked again at the new growing edge and baffles were placed around treatment patches. After phase one, there was no significant difference in growth rates between treatments in either year. In both years, applying the treatment reduced growth rates by approximately 30% compared to control patches. Condition index at the end of phase two showed the reverse and was lower for control mussels. Untreated control patches also showed a significant temporal effect (i.e. differences in growth between the two phases) during 2004 but not 2006. The results clearly show that bottom-up factors associated with food-supply operate at very small, within-shore scales, strongly influencing growth rates and possibly competitive abilities. They also indicate that bottom-up and top-down effects can interact across multiple spatial scales. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The presence, abundance, composition, and growth of periphyton are controlled or influenced by 5 broad classes of environmental variation disturbances, stressors, resources, hydraulic conditions, and biotic interactions In turn, periphyton communities affect water chemistry, hydraulic conditions, habitat availability, and foodweb dynamics This review focuses on responses of periphyton communities to environmental variation. A specific objective of the review is to identify robust periphyton-environment relationships and insightful concepts Contributors to J-NABS have led the field in testing and expanding concepts in periphyton ecology J-NABS papers about periphyton patch dynamics, light- and nutrient-limited periphyton growth, and the effects of disturbances on periphyton structure and function have been particularly influential However, many topics in periphyton ecology remain unexplored and under-explored These topics Include resource colimitation, physiological responses to stressors, allelopathy, competitive inhibition and exclusion, and the effects of drag forces and turbulence Periphyton ecology Studies in J-NABS tend to be multivariable, phenomenological, and nonmechanistic Such Studies provide information about temporal and spatial patterns, but rarely provide evidence for the causes of those patterns. These Studies are often impaired by low statistical power and Insufficient experimental control Periphyton ecology needs more rigorous manipulative experiments, particularly experiments that generate clear relationships between environmental drivers and ecological responses.

AB We Summarized Studies on the impacts and scale effects of negative (competition, predation, parasitism, herbivory) and positive (mutualism, commensalism, indirect facilitation) species interactions in freshwater benthic habitats since similar to 1986 and focused on organisms with mainly or entirely aquatic life cycles. Benthologists publishing in J-NABS have contributed robustly to our overall knowledge of predation and herbivory but less so of other species interactions. Predators can limit the abundance of benthic prey and affect prey size or age Structure, behavior, and morphology, and these effects can be transmitted through food webs and ecosystems. Herbivores can limit biomass of benthic algae, alter physiognomy, species composition and diversity, and stoichiometry, and exert strong indirect effects within food webs and nutrient cycles. Parasites can alter host behavior or morphology, but few Studies have shown that lethal/sublethal effects of parasites on their hosts have population- or community-scale consequences. Fishes and macroinvertebrates occasionally experience competition, but the effect of competition on demographies and assemblages appears restricted to local scales, perhaps because competition can be modulated by many biotic (bioenergetic efficiency, parasitism, predation) and abiotic (floods, drought, resource distribution) factors. Positive interactions have been the least Studied species interaction by benthologists, but interest is growing Future study of population-scale positive interactions and nontraditional interactions at larger scales (e g, riparian effects on benthic habitat stabilization, cross-system recruitment of different life stages) will improve our understanding of freshwater benthic ecosystems and their conservation We urge benthologists to explore how Populations evolve in response to biotic interactions embedded in benthic communities and to assess how these responses might redefine trophic and community structure and their emergent properties

AB Species interactions have been recently depicted its networks. in which each species is connected to one, or more other species in binary interaction matrices. Forty networks of epiphytic orchid and host tree species were assessed in Brazilian gallery forests. The nestedness of the networks was estimated with the NODF index and the significance was tested with null models. The phylogenetic structure of the network was also assessed. by searching for phylogenetic signals in the number of interactions and in the similarity of interacting species. In total 105 orchid species and 132 host tree species were sampled. A nested pattern in all orchid-host tree networks was found. However, phylogenetic signals were not observed. The results support, that the host specificity of orchids is small and most of the interactions occur among generalist orchids and generalist host trees. while the concept of species-specificity can thus be rejected. the extreme alternative - that interacting orchids and host trees arc not a random subset of the regional species pool - cart be dismissed as well. However. factors other than phylogenetic history may structure interaction networks of epiphytic orchids and host trees.

AB The stress-gradient hypothesis (SGH) predicts that the community-wide prevalence of positive interactions, relative to negative interactions, is greater under more severe environmental conditions. Because the frequency of positive and negative interactions within a community is the aggregate of multiple pair-wise interactions, one approach to testing the SGH is to examine how pair-wise interactions vary along severity gradients. While the SGH suggests that the net outcome of an interaction should monotonically become more positive with increasing environmental severity, recent studies have suggested that the severity-interaction relationship (SIR) may rather be unimodal. We tested which of the proposed shapes of the SIR best fits the variation in the interaction between two species along two types of severity gradients on sub-Antarctic Marion Island. This was done by comparing the performance of the grass Agrostis magellanica in the presence and absence of the cushion plant Azorella selago, along both species' entire altitudinal ranges (transects spanning 4-8 km), and along a shorter (transect = 0.4 km) wind exposure gradient. Along the altitudinal transects the relative intensity, but not the absolute intensity or the importance, of the Azorella selago-Agrostis magellanica interaction increased with altitude, consistently forming a plateau-shaped SIR with a positive asymptote. Thus, while the performance of Agrostis magellanica was negatively affected by Azorella selago at low altitudes, the grass benefited from growing on the cushion plant under greater environmental severity. Along the wind exposure gradient the intensity of the interaction also became more positive with increasing environmental severity for most performance measures. This suggests that the switch from a net negative to a net positive interaction can occur across both short and long distances. Therefore, this study provides strong evidence for a plateau-shaped SIR, and confirms that the SIR is unimodal along the particular non-resource severity gradients of this study.

AB Patterns of species occurrence and abundance are influenced by abiotic factors and biotic interactions, but these factors are difficult to disentangle without experimental manipulations. In this study, we used observational and experimental approaches to investigate the role of temperature and interspecific competition in controlling the structure of ground-foraging ant communities in forests of the Siskiyou Mountains of southwestern Oregon. To assess the potential role of competition, we first Used null model analyses to ask whether species partition temporal and/or spatial environments. TO understand how thermal tolerances influence the structure Of Communities, we conducted a laboratory experiment to estimate the maximum thermal tolerance of workers and a field experiment in which we added shaded microhabitats and monitored the response of foragers. Finally, to evaluate the roles of temperature and interspecific competition in the field, we simultaneously manipulated shading and the presence of a dominant competitor (Formica moki). The foraging activity of species broadly overlapped during the diurnal range of temperatures. Species co-occurrence patterns varied across the diurnal temperature range: species were spatially segregated at bait stations at low temperatures, but co-occurred randomly at high temperatures. The decreased abundance of the co-occurring themophilic Temnothorax nevadensis in shaded plots was a direct effect of shading and not an indirect effect of competitive interactions. Thermal tolerance predicted the response of ant species to the shading experiment: species with the lowest tolerances to high temperatures showed the greatest increase ill abundance in the shaded plots. Moreover, species with more similar thermal tolerance values segregated more frequently oil baits than did species that differed in their thermal tolerances. Collectively, our results suggest that thermal tolerances of ants may mediate competitive effects in habitats that experience strong diurnal temperature fluctuations.

AB Since 1989, we have conducted a large-scale ecological experiment in semiarid thorn scrub of a national park in north-central Chile. Initially, we focused on the role of biotic interactions including predation, interspecific competition, and herbivory in small mammal and plant components of the community. We utilized a reductionist approach with replicated 0.56 ha fenced grids that selectively excluded vertebrate predators and/or larger small mammal herbivores such as the degu, Octodon degas. Although we detected small transitory effects of predator exclusions on degu survival and numbers, other species failed to show responses. Similarly, interspecific competition (i.e., degus with other small mammals) had no detectable numerical effects (although some behavioral responses occurred), and degu-exclusions had relatively small effects on various plant components. Modeling approaches indicate that abiotic factors play a determining role in the dynamics of principal small mammal species such as O. degas and the leaf-eared mouse (Phyllotis darwini). In turn, these are mainly related to aperiodic pulses of higher rainfall (usually during El Nino events) which trigger ephemeral plant growth; a food addition experiment. in 1997-2000 verified the importance of precipitation as a determinant of food availability. Since 2004, we have expanded long-term monitoring efforts to other important community components including birds and insects in order to understand effects of abiotic factors on them; we report some of the first results of comprehensive surveys on the former in this region. Finally, we recently shifted focus to documenting effects of exotic lagomorphs in the park. We installed additional treatments selectively excluding small mammals, lagomorphs, or both, from replicated grids in order to evaluate putative herbivore impacts. In conjunction with increased annual rainfall since 2000, we predict that introduced lagomorphs will have increasing impacts in this region, and that more frequent El Ninos in conjunction with global climatic change may lead to marked changes in community dynamics. The importance of long-term experimental studies is underscored by the fact that only now after 20 years of work are some patterns becoming evident.

AB The theory of maximum sustainable yield (MSY) underpins many fishery management regimes and is applied principally as a single species concept. Using a simple dynamic biomass production model we show that MSY can be identified from a long time series of multi-stock data at a regional scale in the presence of species interactions and environmental change. It suggests that MSY is robust and calculable in a multispecies environment, offering a realistic reference point for fishery management. Furthermore, the demonstration of the existence of MSY shows that it is more than a purely theoretical concept. There has been an improvement in the status of stocks in the Northeast Atlantic, but our analysis suggests further reductions in fishing effort would improve long-term yields.

AB While the generally negative consequences of introduced species are well known, little is appreciated on the role of the evolutionary history of plants with herbivores in mediating the indirect impacts of herbivory. We examined how variation in plant resistance and tolerance traits can mediate the effects of herbivory and can have differential indirect impacts on other species and processes. We used two examples of a native and an introduced herbivore, Castor canadensis (American beaver) and Cervus elaphus (Rocky Mountain elk) with Populus spp. to test a conceptual model regarding possible outcomes of species interactions with native and exotic mammalian herbivores. Using these two herbivore test cases, we make two predictions to create testable hypotheses across systems and taxa: First, adaptive traits of tolerance or resistance to herbivory will be fewer when exotic species feed on plant species with which they have no evolutionary history. Second, historical constraints of species interactions will allow for negative feedbacks to stabilize the effects of herbivory by a native species. Overall, these two case studies illustrate that plant resistance and tolerance traits can mediate the indirect consequences of herbivory on associated interacting species. Specifically, when there is no evolutionary history between the plants and herbivores, which is often the case with species introductions, the effects of herbivory are more likely to reduce genetic variation and habitat mosaics, thus indirectly affecting associated species.

AB Statistical modeling of areas of distribution of species by correlative analysis of the environmental features of known presences has become widespread. However, to a large degree, the logic and the functioning of many of these applications remain obscure, not only due to the fact that some of the modeling methods are intrinsically complex (neural networks, genetic algorithms, generalized additive models, for example), but mainly because the role of other ecological processes affecting the species distributions sometimes is not explicitly stated. Resorting to fundamental principles of population ecology, a scheme of analysis based on separation of three factors affecting species distributions (environment, biotic interactions and movements) is used to clarify some results of niche modeling exercises. The area of distribution of a virtual species which was generated by both environmental and biotic factors serves to illustrate the possibility that, at coarse resolutions, the distribution can be approximately recovered using only information about the environmental factors and ignoring the biotic interactions. Finally, information on the distribution of a butterfly species, Baronia brevicornis, is used to illustrate the importance of interpreting the results of niche models by including hypothesis about one class of movements. The results clarify the roles of the three factors in interpreting the results of using correlative approaches to modeling species distributions or their niches.

AB High herbivore pressure is expected to benefit unpalatable species that co-occur with palatable browsed species. However, for five unpalatable understory species we found no evidence of benefit from deer browse. Detailed Studies of one species in natural populations, Arisaema triphyllum, revealed surprising changes in its Population structure and demography: deer browse level on a palatable species significantly correlates with reduced plant size and seed rain and male-biased sex ratios of co-occurring Arisaema populations. Analyses of individual size in five unpalatable forest plant species in long-term experimental paired deer exclosure/deer access plots corroborate the natural site results; all five species were smaller in deer access plots. Analyses of abiotic variables in natural and experimental sites suggest one potential mechanism for indirect effects of deer. Deer-mediated soil quality declines included increased soil penetration resistance and decreased leaf litter depth, which are known to hinder plant growth. Our results are likely applicable to other unpalatable forest species and have clear consequences for understory biodiversity. Unpalatable plant species in forests experiencing high deer numbers may be in decline along with their palatable neighbors. Our study implicates deer overabundance in the cascade of forest species decline and the urgency of this conservation issue in North America.

AB Epiphytes are an important component of many forested ecosystems, yet our understanding of epiphyte communities lags far behind that of terrestrial-based plant communities. This discrepancy is exacerbated by the lack of a theoretical context to assess patterns in epiphyte community structure. We attempt to fill this gap by developing an analytical framework to investigate epiphyte assemblages, which we then apply to a data set on epiphyte distributions in a Panamanian rain forest. On a coarse scale, interactions between epiphyte species and host tree species can be viewed as bipartite networks, similar to pollination and seed dispersal networks. On a finer scale, epiphyte communities on individual host trees can be viewed as meta-communities, or suites of local epiphyte Communities connected by dispersal. Similar analytical tools are typically employed to investigate species interaction networks and meta-communities, thus providing a unified analytical framework to investigate coarse-scale (network) and fine-scale (meta-community) patterns in epiphyte distributions. Coarse-scale analysis of the Panamanian data set showed that most epiphyte species interacted with fewer host species than expected by chance. Fine-scale analyses showed that epiphyte species richness on individual trees was lower than null model expectations. Therefore, epiphyte distributions were clumped at both scales, perhaps as a result of dispersal. limitations. Scale-dependent patterns in epiphyte species composition were observed. Epiphyte-host networks showed evidence of negative co-occurrence patterns, which Could arise from adaptations among epiphyte species to avoid competition for host species, while most epiphyte meta-communi ties were distributed at random. Application Of our "meta-network" analytical framework in other locales may help to identify general patterns in the structure of epiphyte assemblages and their variation in space and time.

AB P>1. Selective pressures acting on foraging activities constrain the strength of interaction, hence the stability and energetic availability in food webs.
   2. Because such selective pressures are usually measured at the individual level and because most experimental and theoretical works focus on simple settings, linking adaptive foraging with community scale patterns is still a far stretch.
   3. Some recent models incorporate foraging adaptation in diverse communities. The models vary in the way they incorporate adaptation, via evolutionary or behavioural changes, and define individual fitness in various ways.
   4. In spite of these differences, some general results linking adaptation to community structure and functioning emerge. In the present article, I introduce these different models and highlight their common results.
   5. Adaptive foraging provides stability to large food web models and predicts successfully interaction patterns within food webs as well as other topological features such as food chain length.
   6. The relationships between adaptive foraging and other structuring factors particularly depend on how well connected the local community is with surrounding communities (metacommunity aspect).

AB P>1. Patterns of species co-existence and species diversity in plant communities remain an important research area despite over a century of intensive scrutiny. To provide mechanistic insight into the rules governing plant species co-existence and diversity, plant community ecologists are increasingly quantifying functional trait values for the species found in a wide range of communities.
   2. Despite the promise of a quantitative functional trait approach to plant community ecology, we suggest that, along with examining trait variation across species, an assessment of trait variation within species should also be a key component of a trait-based approach to community ecology. Variability within and between individuals and populations is likely widespread due to plastic responses to highly localized abiotic and biotic interactions.
   3. In this study, we quantify leaf trait variation within and across ten co-existing tree species in a dry tropical forest in Costa Rica to ask: (i) whether the majority of trait variation is located between species, within species, within individuals or within the leaves themselves; (ii) whether trait values collected using standardized methods correlate with those collected using unstandardized methods; and (iii) to what extent can we differentiate plant species on the basis of their traits?
   4. We find that the majority of variation in traits was often explained by between species differences; however, between leaflet trait variation was very high for compound-leaved species. We also show that many species are difficult to reliably differentiate on the basis of functional traits even when sampling many individuals.
   5. We suggest an ideal sample size of at least 10, and ideally 20, individuals be used when calculating mean trait values for individual species for entire communities, though even at large sample sizes, it remains unclear if community level trait values will allow comparisons on a larger geographic scale or if species traits are generally similar across scales. It will thus be critical to account for intraspecific variation by comparing species mean trait values across space in multiple microclimatic environments within local communities and along environmental gradients. Further, quantifying trait variability due to plasticity and inheritance will provide a better understanding of the underlying patterns and drivers of trait variation as well as the application of functional traits in outlining mechanisms of species co-existence.

AB There has been considerable recent interest concerning the impact of climate change on a wide range of taxa. However, little is known about how the biogeographic affinities of taxa may affect their responses to these impacts. Our main aim was to study how predicted climate change will affect the distribution of 28 European bat species grouped by their biogeographic patterns as determined by a spatial Principal Component Analysis. Using presence-only modelling techniques and climatic data (minimum temperature, average temperature, precipitation, humidity and daily temperature range) for four different climate change scenarios (IPCC scenarios ranging from the most extreme A1FI, A2, B2 to the least severe, B1), we predict the potential geographic distribution of bat species in Europe grouped according to their biogeographic patterns for the years 2020-2030, 2050-2060 and 2090-2100. Biogeographic patterns exert a great influence on a species' response to climate change. Bat species more associated with colder climates, hence northern latitudes, could be more severely affected with some extinctions predicted by the end of the century. The Mediterranean and Temperate groups seem to be more tolerant of temperature increases, however, their projections varied considerably under different climate change scenarios. Scenario A1FI was clearly the most detrimental for European bat diversity, with several extinctions and declines in occupied area predicted for several species. The B scenarios were less damaging and even predicted that some species could increase their geographical ranges. However, all models only took into account climatic envelopes whereas available habitat and species interactions will also probably play an important role in delimiting future distribution patterns. The models may therefore generate 'best case' predictions about future changes in the distribution of European bats.

AB The majority of studies on environmental change focus on the response of single species and neglect fundamental biotic interactions, such as mutualism, competition, predation, and parasitism, which complicate patterns of species persistence. Under global warming, disruption of community interactions can arise when species differ in their sensitivity to rising temperature, leading to mismatched phenologies and/or dispersal patterns. To study species persistence under global climate change, it is critical to consider the ecology and evolution of multispecies interactions; however, the sheer number of potential interactions makes a full study of all interactions unfeasible. One mechanistic approach to solving the problem of complicated community context to global change is to (i) define strategy groups of species based on life-history traits, trophic position, or location in the ecosystem, (ii) identify species involved in key interactions within these groups, and (iii) determine from the interactions of these key species which traits to study in order to understand the response to global warming. We review the importance of multispecies interactions looking at two trait categories: thermal sensitivity of metabolic rate and associated life-history traits and dispersal traits of species. A survey of published literature shows pronounced and consistent differences among trophic groups in thermal sensitivity of life-history traits and in dispersal distances. Our approach increases the feasibility of unraveling such a large and diverse set of community interactions, with the ultimate goal of improving our understanding of community responses to global warming.

AB Genetic diversity within species is a potentially important, but poorly studied, determinant of plant community dynamics. Here we report experiments testing the influence of genotype identity and genotypic diversity both on the invasibility of a foundation, matrix-forming species (Kentucky bluegrass, Poa pratensis), and on the invasiveness of a colonizing species (dandelion, Taraxacum officinale). Genotypes of Kentucky bluegrass in monoculture showed significant variation in productivity and resistance to dandelion invasion, but the productivity and invasion resistance of genotypic mixtures were not significantly different from those of genotypic monocultures. Indirect evidence suggested temporal shifts in the genotypic composition of mixtures. Dandelion genotypes in monoculture showed striking and significant variation in productivity and seed production, but there was no significant tendency for these variables in mixtures to deviate from null expectations based on monocultures. However, productivity and seed production of dandelion mixtures were consistently greater than those of the two least productive genotypes, and statistically indistinguishable from those of the three most productive genotypes, suggesting the possibility of greater invasiveness of genotypically diverse populations in the long run due to dominance by highly productive genotypes. In both experiments, the identity of genotypes was far more important than genetic diversity per se.

AB Communication and information are central concepts in evolutionary biology. In fact, it is hard to find an area of biology where these concepts are not used. However, quantifying the information transferred in biological interactions has been difficult. How much information is transferred when the first spring rainfall hits a dormant seed, or when a chick begs for food from its parent? One measure that is commonly used in such cases is fitness value: by how much, on average, an individual's fitness would increase if it behaved optimally with the new information, compared to its average Fitness without the information. Another measure, often used to describe neural responses to sensory stimuli, is the mutual information - a measure of reduction in uncertainty, as introduced by Shannon in communication theory. However, mutual information has generally not been considered to be an appropriate measure for describing developmental or behavioral responses at the organismal level, because it is blind to function; it does not distinguish between relevant and irrelevant information. In this paper we show that there is in fact a Surprisingly tight connection between these two measures in the important context of evolution in an uncertain environment. In this case, a useful Measure of fitness benefit is the increase in the long-term growth rate, or the fold increase in number of surviving lineages. We show that in many cases the fitness value of a developmental cue, when measured this way, is exactly equal to the reduction in uncertainty about the environment, as described by the mutual information.

AB It has been recently proposed that the decrease in diversity towards the severe end of the humped-back diversity-biomass model of Grime was driven by a collapse of facilitation due to extreme conditions of either stress or physical disturbance. In order to test the hypothesis that disturbance is the primary direct factor driving the collapse of interactions occurring along environmental severity gradients, we conducted a removal experiment in the highly stressed French coastal dunes along a gradient of disturbance due to sand burial. Four dune species were used as targets and transplanted with and without neighbours in four communities along the gradient. The experiment was conducted twice, a dry and an average year. Results of the experiment showed that during the dry year the effect of the environment was prominent and only one species was facilitated for survival in the least disturbed community. During the average year, interactions for growth were important only in the same community, with positive or negative responses depending on the natural position of the target species within the coastal dune gradient. In accordance with our hypothesis, most interactions for both survival and growth were observed in the least disturbed community exhibiting the highest diversity. There were no interactions in the most disturbed community with the lowest diversity.

AB Source-sink dynamics may be ubiquitous in ecology. We developed a theory for source-sink dynamics using spatial extensions of the net reproductive value, R (0), which has been used elsewhere to define fitness, disease eradication, population growth, and invasion risk. R (0) decomposes into biologically meaningful components-lifetime reproductive output, survival, and dispersal-that are widely adaptable and easily interpreted. The theory provides a general quantitative means for relating fundamental niche, biotic interactions, dispersal, and species distributions. We applied the methods to Dreissena and found a resolution to a paradox in invasion biology-competitive coexistence between quagga (Dreissena bugensis) and zebra (D. polymorpha) mussels among lakes despite extensive niche overlap within lakes. Source-sink dynamics within lakes between deepwater and shallow habitats, which favor quagga and zebra mussels, respectively, yield a metacommunity distribution where quagga mussels dominate large lakes and zebra mussels dominate small lakes. The source-sink framework may also be useful in spatial competition theory, habitat conservation, marine protected areas, and ecological responses to climate change.

AB We study frequency-dependent seed predation (FDP) in a model of competing annual plant species in a variable environment. The combination of a variable environment and competition leads to the storage-effect coexistence mechanism (SE), which is a leading hypothesis for coexistence of desert annual plants. However, seed predation in such systems demands attention to coexistence mechanisms associated with predation. FDP is one such mechanism, which promotes coexistence by shifting predation to more abundant plant species, facilitating the recovery of species perturbed to low density. When present together, FDP and SE interact, undermining each other's effects. Predation weakens competition, and therefore weakens mechanisms associated with competition: here SE. However, the direct effect of FDP in promoting coexistence can compensate or more than compensate for this weakening of SE. On the other hand, the environmental variation necessary for SE weakens FOR With high survival of dormant seeds, SE can be strong enough to compensate, or overcompensate, for the decline in FDP, provided predation is not too strong. Although FDP and SE may simultaneously contribute to coexistence, their combined effect is less than the sum of their separate effects, and is often less than the effect of the stronger mechanism when present alone.

AB A model is presented to predict sanitary felling of Norway spruce (Picea abies) due to spruce bark beetles (Ips typographus, Pityogenes chalcographus) in Slovenia according to different climate change scenarios. The model incorporates 21 variables that are directly or indirectly related to the dependent variable, and that can be arranged into five groups: climate, forest, landscape, topography, and soil. The soil properties are represented by 8 variables, 4 variables define the topography, 4 describe the climate, 4 define the landscape, and one additional variable provides the quantity of Norway spruce present in the model cell. The model was developed using the M5' model tree. The basic spatial unit of the model is 1 km(2), and the time resolution is I year. The model evaluation was performed by three different measures: (1) the correlation coefficient (51.9%),(2) the Theil's inequality coefficient (0.49) and (3) the modelling efficiency (0.32). Validation of the model was carried out by 10-fold cross-validation. The model tree consists of 28 linear models, and model was calculated for three different climate change scenarios extending over a period until 2100, in 10-year intervals. The model is valid for the entire area of Slovenia; however, climate change projections were made only for the Maribor region (596 km(2)). The model assumes that relationships among the incorporated factors will remain unchanged under climate change, and the influence of humans was not taken into account. The structure of the model reveals the great importance of landscape variables, which proved to be positively correlated with the dependent variable. Variables that describe the water regime in the model cell were also highly correlated with the dependent variable, with evapotranspiration and parent material being of particular importance. The results of the model support the hypothesis that bark beetles do greater damage to Norway spruce artificially planted out of its native range in Slovenia, i.e., lowlands and soils rich in N, P, and K. The model calculation for climate change scenarios in the Maribor region shows an increase in sanitary felling of Norway spruce due to spruce bark beetles, for all scenarios. The model provides a path towards better understanding of the complex ecological interactions involved in bark beetle outbreaks. Potential application of the results in forest management and planning is discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Using the Noah's Ark problem - the problem of efficiently allocating limited funds to conserve biodiversity the standard economic approach to endangered species conservation constructs a human-centered biodiversity by favoring species directly valuable to humans. I analyze this approach and draw on the functional ecology literature to offer an alternative emphasizing the role species play in their ecosystems. The aim is to create a working ecosystem on the Ark rather than a collection of charismatic and distinct species. To do so, I construct a new measure of a species' ecological importance and an ecological objective appropriate for cost-effective resource allocation. The ecological approach fundamentally changes the notion of species-value from a direct value based on a species' appearance or taxonomic difference to an indirect value based on a species' ecological role in its ecosystem. in the process, 'populations' of species become the fundamental unit of biodiversity rather than 'species', and abiotic processes also possess value. When compared to the economic approach, the ecological approach prioritizes different species for the Ark and achieves superior economic outcomes in all but the mythical Noah's Ark scenario where interactions are non-existent. The analysis challenges the approach of US endangered species legislation and I call for a reformulation based on endangered ecological interactions. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The analysis of co-occurrence patterns between plant species is being increasingly employed to Study biotic interactions at the community level. We investigated changes in such patterns along two different abiotic stress gradients in eight sand-dune plant communities of the western coast of Portugal. We sampled a total of 72 transects consisting on 25 1 m(2) quadrats each, and we calculated the standardized effect size for each transect (SES), i.e. the differences between the observed co-occurrence patterns and Simulated patterns for a random co-occurrence. The relationships between the average SES values for each site and the abiotic stress gradients, defined by the north-south geographic gradient (a surrogate of the climatic stress) and total plant cover (a surrogate of productivity), were analyzed. The factors driving co-occurrence patterns at smaller spatial scale were also investigated by a stepwise multiple regression analysis. Average SES values were significantly higher than zero in five of the studied sites, indicating lower species co-occurrence than expected by chance. These results suggest that the studied sand-dune communities studied are structured mainly by competitive interactions. At the site scale, SES values were not related to plant cover or the location along the north-south gradient. However, at the transect scale, SES values were inversely explained by different abiotic factors (the geographic position along the north-south gradient and the plant cover). Our results indicate that the magnitude and the shifts in co-occurrence patterns along environmental gradients varied with the spatial scale and the surrogate of abiotic stress considered.

AB In this paper, we tested the hypothesis that natural catastrophes may destroy non-random community structure in natural assemblages of organisms. As a study system, we selected fire as the catastrophic event, and two groups of soil arthropods (Collembola and Isopoda Oniscidea) as target organisms. By co-occurrence analyses and Monte Carlo simulations of niche overlap analysis (C-score, with fixed-equiprobable model; RA2 and RA3 algorithms) we evaluated whether the community structure of these two groups were random/non-random at three unburnt sites and at three neighbour burnt sites that were devastated by a large-scale fire in summer 2000. Both taxa experienced a remarkable reduction in the number of species sampled in burnt versus unburnt sites, but the difference among sites was not statistically significant for Oniscidea. We determined that community structure was clearly non-random at the unburnt sites for both Collembola (according to RA3 algorithm) and Isopoda Oniscidea (according to co-occurrence analysis) and that, as predicted by theory, the catastrophic event did deeply alter the community structure by removing the non-random organization of the species interactions. We also observed a shift from segregation to aggregation/randomness in soil arthropods communities affected by fire, a pattern that was similar to that observed in natural communities of organisms perturbed by the introduction of alien species, thus indicating that this pattern may be generalizable when alteration of Communities may occur.

AB The cyanobacterial genera Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus are key phototrophic organisms in the open ocean, and ecological interactions between these groups and heterotrophic bacteria have fundamental importance for marine carbon and nutrient cycling. We applied a microfluidic chemotaxis assay to study the chemotactic response of 3 marine bacterial isolates (Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis, Vibrio alginolyticus and Silicibacter sp. TM1040) to the chemical products of Synechococcus elongatus and Prochlorococcus marinus MED 4Ax. In the ocean, chemical products from these cyanobacteria may be released into the water column via extracellular exudation or cell lysis. Strong and rapid chemotactic responses by all 3 bacterial strains occurred in reaction to the Synechococcus products. P. haloplanktis cells exhibited the strongest attraction, accumulating within the chemoattractant band in concentrations of up to 9-fold above background levels. Positive chemotaxis to Prochlorococcus chemical products also occurred, with P. haloplanktis and Silicibacter sp. TM1040 exhibiting the strongest responses. These observations indicate that marine bacteria can exhibit behavioural responses to the chemical products of Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus, which may support ecological associations between these important populations of marine prokaryotes in the environment.

AB Laboratory microcosms were used to determine how leaf degradation processes (C-CO2 release and leaf mass loss) are affected by the diversity of soil macro-invertebrate assemblages (comprising earthworms, woodlice and millipedes). The relationships were tested using different measures of diversity (number of species and trait dissimilarities). Net diversity effects and transgressive overyielding, were calculated to disentangle the relative impacts of negative, neutral and positive species interactions on the relationships observed.
   Minimum trait dissimilarities were found to be correlated with leaf mass loss and, to a lesser extent, with C-CO2 release. This suggests that process rates increase as trait similarity in species assemblage decreases. Conversely, increasing the number of species resulted in the saturation of process rates after 1-2 species had been added to a microcosm. The process rates observed could mainly be explained by positive species interactions (40-50% of microcosms being process-dependent), followed by neutral interactions (20-40%) and selection effects or negative interactions (less than 20%). These results thus suggest that the effects of a soil macro-invertebrate assemblage on soil processes are more likely to he driven by complementarity or facilitation than by competition.

AB The process of crop domestication involves artificial selection for beneficial traits in plants, such as yield, standard development times for ease of harvest, and pest and disease resistance. This process has greatly improved crop performance and can allow farmers to produce viable harvests in previously un-profitable circumstances. However, there is growing evidence that domestication may impact species interactions perhaps through the amplification of effects across spatial scales and so have a pervasive influence on the functioning and sustainability of agro-ecosystems. This can occur directly, through unintentional alteration to crop traits that disrupt the host-finding ability of natural enemies; or indirectly through alterations to within-plant nutritional quality that impacts herbivore size and density and then ramifies throughout food chains. At the field level, the low variability in traits between individual plants means that particular weed and invertebrate communities are associated with each crop type. At the landscape level, the use of one or a few varieties across wide spatial scales, planted and harvested relatively synchronously, further reduces diversity. This process acting across multiple spatial scales represents a considerable selection pressure that may result in feedback-loops which favour the occurrence of particular traits within the community (e.g. resistance to pesticides). In order to properly balance the 'pros and cons' of the widespread adoption of new varieties, for the future, we must consider how particular traits influence interactions within the wider ecological community, and how these effects amplify across spatial scales. Here we argue that the process of domestication (with the primary goal of yield increases) and the widespread use of a few varieties has led to potentially detrimental impacts on species interactions, and suggest possible strategies for mitigating some of these negative impacts in the future.

AB Functional biodiversity research explores drivers and functional consequences of biodiversity changes Land use change is a major driver of changes of biodiversity and of biogeochemical and biological ecosystem processes and services However, land use effects on genetic and species diversity are well documented only for a few taxa and trophic networks We hardly know how different components of biodiversity and their responses to land use change are interrelated and very little about the simultaneous, and interacting, effects of land use on multiple ecosystem processes and services Moreover, we do not know to what extent land use effects on ecosystem processes and services are mediated by biodiversity change Thus, overall goals are on the one hand to understand the effects of land use on biodiversity and on the other to understand the modifying role of biodiversity change for land-use effects on ecosystem processes, including biogeochemical cycles To comprehensively address these Important questions, we recently established a new large-scale and long-term project for functional biodiversity, the Biodiversity Exploratories (www biodiversity-exploratories de) They comprise a hierarchical set of standardized field plots in three different regions of Germany covering manifold management types and intensities in grasslands and forests They serve as a joint research platform for currently 40 projects involving over 300 people studying various aspects of the relationships between land use biodiversity and ecosystem processes through monitoring, comparative observation and experiments We introduce guiding questions, concept and design of the Biodiversity Exploratories - including main aspects of selection and implementation of field plots and project structure - and we discuss the significance of this approach for further functional biodiversity research This includes the crucial relevance of a common study design encompassing variation in both drivers and outcomes of biodiversity change and ecosystem processes, the interdisciplinary integration of biodiversity and ecosystem researchers, the training of a new generation of integrative biodiversity researchers, and the stimulation of functional biodiversity research in real landscape contexts, in Germany and elsewhere (C) 2010 Gesellschaft fur Okologie Published by Elsevier GmbH All rights reserved

AB Disentangling the contribution of biotic interactions (density-dependent) and environmental heterogeneity (density-independent) to the formation of spatial patterns between predators and prey is crucial for a better understanding of food-web interactions Most techniques for the analysis of spatial patterns assume that abiotic processes influence the distribution of individuals with similar intensity at all locations of a study area (stationarity) This simplification may result in a spurious description of predator prey associations in environmentally heterogeneous habitats In a spatially explicit way we sampled ground-active linyphiid and lycosid spiders and their Collembola prey along a forest-meadow gradient and analysed the change in spatial relationships with time We used techniques of point pattern analysis and pair-correlation functions to summarize spatial patterns To disentangle the contribution of biotic interactions and environmental heterogeneity on pattern formation we compared observed functions with those arising from null models either assuming environmental homogeneity or accounting for habitat heterogeneity All taxa were aggregated at the three sampling periods if habitat homogeneity was assumed, but only linyphiid spiders were still clustered after accounting for environmental heterogeneity A similarly contrasting result was present for the spatial relationship between predators and their prey, with association under the assumption of homogeneity, but strong repulsion that intensified with time if accounting for environmental heterogeneity Results from additional bivariate null models under which either predator or prey locations were fixed, suggest that Collembola showed lower activity density in more suitable, but predator-rich habitats Biotic interactions were important drivers of the spatial distribution of ground-active predators and their decomposer prey in the analysed forest floor food-web However, these structuring forces remain hidden when using simple spatial models that ignore environmental heterogeneity Therefore, for understanding predator prey interactions in spatially complex habitats, such as grasslands and forests, spatial models considering habitat heterogeneity are indispensible

AB Competition effects on community development are difficult to quantify in species-rich plant communities due to the complexity of possible interactions. We used multispecies mixtures to investigate how species identity and competitive interactions influence the development of plant communities. Given the same set of species with differing initial abundance in various communities, we tested whether communities would become more similar (converge) or dissimilar (diverge) over time depending on the relative importance of species identity and competition. Twenty-four experimental communities were established by planting seedlings of twelve wetland species at different relative abundances and absolute densities. The development of the communities was monitored over three years, and yearly changes in biomass were modelled as a linear function of the species biomass at the start of each period. After three years, a clear dominance structure had developed, with four species making up 80% of the aboveground biomass. In all three years, community dynamics was driven by differences in relative growth rates among the species (i.e. an effect of species identity). However, in the second and third years negative density dependence was also important, with changes in the relative abundance of the most abundant species being negatively related to their biomass at the start of the period. Multiple species interactions though generally weaker than effects of species identity and intraspecific competition became increasingly important and also contributed to the dominance pattern. It is concluded that species identity and negative density dependence of the dominant species were the most important factors causing the experimental plant communities to converge.

AB Different biotic interactions may influence one another to produce complex patterns of direct and indirect effects, which together influence plant reproductive success. However, so far most studies on plant-animal interactions have focused on single interactions in isolation. In this study, we studied the effect of florivory by the weevil Cionus nigritarsis on pollinator visitation rate in the self-incompatible perennial herb Verbascum nigrum by combining observations of florivory and pollination in natural populations with records of pollinator visitation to plants with different levels of experimentally inflicted damage.
   Increasing levels of damage through either natural or simulated florivory resulted in fewer pollinator visits per plant and per flower. As expected, the magnitude of the indirect effect of florivory on pollinator visitation was proportional to the intensity of florivory. Our results indicate that biotic non-pollinating agents, such as florivores, may induce substantial changes in pollinator availability. Therefore, studies addressing different plant-animal interactions in parallel are necessary to better comprehend the factors influencing the reproductive performance and demography of flowering plants.

AB Hypoxia conditions are increasing throughout the world, influencing biogeochemical cycles of elements and marine life. Hypoxia results from complex interactions between physical and biogeochemical processes, which can not be understood by observations alone. Models are invaluable tools at studying system dynamics, generalizing discrete observations and predicting future states. They are also useful as management tools for evaluating site-specific responses to management scenarios. Here we review oxygen dynamics models that have significantly contributed to a better understanding of the effects of natural processes and human perturbations on the development of hypoxia, factors controlling the extent and temporal variability of coastal hypoxia, and the effects of oxygen depletion on biogeochemical cycles. Because hypoxia occurs in a variety of environments and can be persistent, periodic or episodic, models differ significantly in their complexity and temporal and spatial resolution. We discuss the progress in developing hypoxia models for benthic and pelagic systems that range from simple box models to three dimensional circulation models. Applications of these models in five major hypoxia regions are presented. In the last decades, substantial progress has been made towards the parameterization of biogeochemical processes in both hypoxic water columns and sediments. In coastal regions, semi-empirical models have been used more frequently than mechanistic models to study nutrient enrichment and hypoxia relationships. Recent advances in three-dimensional coupled physical-ecological-biogeochemical models have allowed a better representation of physical-biological interactions in these systems. We discuss the remaining gaps in process descriptions and suggest directions for improvement. Better process representations in models will help us answer several important questions, such as those about the causes of the observed worldwide increase in hypoxic conditions, and future changes in the intensity and spread of coastal hypoxia. At the same time, quantitative model intercomparison studies suggest that the predictive ability of our models may be adversely affected by their increasing complexity, unless the models are properly constrained by observations.

AB Despite the importance of fungi in soil ecosystem services, a theoretical framework that links soil management strategies with fungal ecology is still lacking. One of the key challenges is to understand how the complex geometrical shape of pores in soil affects fungal spread and species interaction. Progress in this area has long been hampered by a lack of experimental techniques for quantification. In this paper we use X-ray computed tomography to quantify and characterize the pore geometry at microscopic scales (30 mu m) that are relevant for fungal spread in soil. We analysed the pore geometry for replicated samples with bulk-densities ranging from 1.2-1.6 g/cm(3). The bulk-density of soils significantly affected the total volume, mean pore diameter and connectivity of the pore volume. A previously described fungal growth model comprising a minimal set of physiological processes required to produce a range of phenotypic responses was used to analyse the effect of these geometric descriptors on fungal invasion, and we showed that the degree and rate of fungal invasion was affected mainly by pore volume and pore connectivity. The presented experimental and theoretical framework is a significant first step towards understanding how environmental change and soil management impact on fungal diversity in soils.

AB A key gap in understanding the long-term success of invasive species is how biotic interactions change with the duration of experience in the introduced range. We examined biotic interactions using a common garden experiment with native, hybrid, and exotic Senecio species representing a range of experience in the UK. Introduced species had fewer aphids and pathogens and more root colonization by mycorrhizal fungi compared to natives; hybrids generally had intermediate levels of interactions. The duration of experience in the introduced range was reflected by an increasing degree of variability in enemy release. These findings support the enemy release hypothesis and indicate the potential for changes in enemy release as time and experience in the new range increase.

AB In this study we analyzed patterns of native and exotic species richness in the urban flora of Brussels (Belgium) using a coarse-scale systematic sampling grid of 1 km(2). The observed correlation between native and exotic richness within the grid cells sampled was then compared to the results of an adequate null model assuming no species interactions. In addition, ordinary least-squares and quantile regressions were used to analyze the relationship between the ratio of exotics to natives and the proportion of densely built up areas in each cell. Though the results obtained conform to the Eltonian expectation that exotic species preferably invade areas of low native species diversity, traditional niche-filling mechanisms seems inadequate to explain the observed pattern. Rather, aliens simply tend to have different environmental requirements than natives.

AB Analyzing the relationships between the distribution of animal species and climatic variables is not only important for understanding which factors govern species distribution but also for improving our ability to predict future ecological responses to climate change. In the context of global climate change, amphibians are of particular interest because of their extreme sensitivity to the variation of temperature and precipitation regimes. We analyzed species-climate relationships for 17 amphibian species occurring in Italy using species distribution data at the 10 x 10 km resolution. A machine learning method, Random Forests, was used to model the distribution of amphibians in relation to a set of 18 climatic variables. The results showed that the variables which had the highest importance were those related to precipitation, indicating that precipitation is an important factor in determining amphibian distribution. Future projections showed a complex response of species distributions, emphasizing the potential severity of climate change on the distributions of amphibians in Italy. The species that will decrease the most are those occurring in mountainous and Mediterranean areas. Our results provide some preliminary information that could be useful for amphibian conservation, indicating if future conservation priorities for some species should be enhanced.

AB Theory predicts that species extinction or invasion can affect the temporal dynamics of ecological communities by altering feedback patterns and by damping or amplifying environmental variation via changes in the network of species interactions, but because of the logistical challenges of investigating temporal dynamics,. evidence from natural ecosystems is lacking. In a long-term experimental manipulation of a rocky intertidal community on Tatoosh Island, Washington, USA, chronic removal of the dominant species Mytilus californianus altered the dynamics of the system, causing reductions in the temporal variability of three subdominant species but no consistent change in the spectral characteristics or the order of density dependence across experimental replicates. This pattern of results Suggests that Mytilus californianus impacted the temporal dynamics by amplifying environmental stochasticity, rather than by changing feedback pathways as is emphasized in most theoretical predictions and laboratory studies. Hence, further investigation of the mechanisms and implications of transmission of environmental stochasticity in natural ecosystems is merited.

AB Ecologists increasingly suspect that climate change will directly impact species physiology. demography, and phenology, but also indirectly affect these measures Via changes to the Surrounding community. Unfortunately, few studies examine both the direct and indirect pathways of impact. Doing so is important because altered competitive pressures can reduce or magnify the direct responses of a focal species to climate change. Here. we examine the effects of changing rainfall on three rare annual plant species in the presence and absence of competition on the California Channel Islands. We used rain-out shelters and hand watering to exclude and augment early, late, and season-long rainfall, spanning the wide range of precipitation change forecast for the region. In the absence of competition, droughts reduced the population growth rates of two of three Cocal annuals, while increased rainfall was only sometimes beneficial. As compared to the focal species, the dominant competitors were more sensitive to the precipitation treatments, benefiting from increased season-long precipitation and harmed by droughts. Importantly, the response of two of three competitors to the precipitation treatments tended to be positively correlated with those of the focal annuals. Although this leads to the expectation that increased competition will counter the direct benefits of favorable conditions, such indirect effects of precipitation change proved weak to nonexistent in our experiment. Competitors had little influence on the precipitation response of two focal species, due to their low sensitivity to competition and highly variable precipitation responses. Competition did affect low our third focal species responded to precipitation change, but this effect only approached significance, and whether it truly resulted from competitor response to precipitation change was unclear. Our work suggests that even, when competitors respond to climate change, these responses may have little effect on the focal species. Ultimately, the strength of the indirect effect depends on how strongly climate change alters competition. and how sensitive focal species are to changes in competition.

AB Climate change presents unprecedented challenges for biological conservation. Agencies are increasingly looking to modeled projections of species' distributions under future climates to inform management strategies. As government scientists with a responsibility to communicate the best available science to our policy colleagues, we question whether current modeling approaches and outputs are practically useful. Here, we synthesize conceptual problems with species distribution models (SDMs) associated with interspecific interactions, dispersal, ecological equilibria and time lags, evolution, and the sampling of niche space. Although projected SDMs have undoubtedly been critical in alerting us to the magnitude of climate change impacts, we conclude that until they offer insights that are more precise than what we can derive from basic ecological theory, we question their utility in deciding how to allocate scarce funds to large-scale conservation projects.

AB Climate change is altering the phenology of many species and the timing of their interactions with other species, but the impacts of these phenological shifts on species interactions remain unclear. Classical approaches to the study of phenology have typically documented changes in the timing of single life-history events, while phenological shifts affect many interactions over entire life histories. In this study, we suggest an approach that integrates the phenology and ontogeny of species interactions with a fitness landscape to provide a common mechanistic framework for investigating phenological shifts. We suggest that this ontogeny-phenology landscape provides a flexible method to document changes in the relative phenologies of interacting species, examine the causes of these phenological shifts, and estimate their consequences for interacting species.

AB We explored the multiple-spatial-scale diversity patterns of canopy and understorey north-temperate mature tree trunk spiders following a hierarchically nested design. We investigated local dynamics and dispersal limitations of canopy and understorey spider assemblages by using a combination of additive partitioning of richness and changes in species composition through spatially nested multivariate ANOVA. Community composition differed significantly between canopy and understorey assemblages and also at stand and site spatial scales, while beta richness was higher than expected from random at the site spatial scale only. Alpha richness did not differ from random at any spatial scale considered in the regional context of our study (tree, stand, and site) and was similar in the canopy and the understorey when rarefied. There was a shift in the contribution of alpha and beta richness as the spatial resolution increased because beta diversity contributed more to tree spider richness and alpha diversity to our site-level spider richness. Our study demonstrates that diversity patterns of mature tree trunk spiders in north-temperate hardwood forests are scale dependent in vertical and horizontal space: at our tree and stand spatial scales, local dynamics such as niche availability and species interactions may drive bark spider assemblage diversity since mean richness did not change significantly whereas species composition did.

AB Species with a wide distribution over latitudinal gradients often exhibit increasing growth and development rates towards higher latitudes. Ecological theory predicts that these fast-growing genotypes are, in the absence of trade-offs with fast growth, better competitors than low-latitude conspecifics. While knowledge on key ecological traits along latitudinal clines is important for understanding how these clines are maintained, the relative competitive ability of high latitude individuals against low latitude conspecifics has not been tested. Growth and development rates of the common frog Rana temporaria increase along the latitudinal gradient across Scandinavia. Here we investigated larval competition over food resources within and between two R. temporaria populations originating from southern and northern Sweden in an outdoor common garden experiment. We used a factorial design, where southern and northern tadpoles were reared either as single populations or as mixes of the two populations at two densities and predator treatments (absence and non-lethal presence of Aeshna dragonfly larvae). Tadpoles from the high latitude population grew and developed faster and in the beginning of the experiment they hid less and were more active than tadpoles from the low latitude population. When raised together with high latitude tadpoles the southern tadpoles had a longer larval period, however, the response of high latitude tadpoles to the competition by low latitude tadpoles did not differ from their response to intra-population competition. This result was not significantly affected by density or predator treatments. Our results support the hypothesis that high latitude populations are better competitors than their low latitude conspecifics, and suggest that in R. temporaria fast growth and development trade off with other fitness components along the latitudinal gradient across Scandinavia.

AB Questions: Are interaction patterns in species interaction networks different from what one expects by chance alone? In particular. are these networks nested a pattern where resources taken by more specialized consumers form a proper subset of those taken by more generalized consumers?
   Organisms: Fifty-nine and 42 networks of mutualistic and host-parasitoid interactions, respectively.
   Analytical methods: For each network, the observed deuce of nestedness is compared with the distribution of nestedness values derived from a collection of 1000 random networks. Those networks with nestedness values lower than 95% of all random values are considered 'unusually nested'. The analysis considers two different metrics of nestedness and live different network randomization algorithms, each of which differs in the ecological assumptions imposed.
   Results: Most ecological networks are unusually nested when compared with loosely constrained random networks. Comparisons with highly constrained networks temper these findings, but we still report a significant preponderance of nested networks (typically those with the most species).
   Conclusions: Bascompte et al (2003) previously showed most observed mutualistic networks to be unusually nested. Later work using more ecologically realistic randomization algorithms cast doubt on those results. Across the largest set of species interactions considered to date, we conclude that an unexpectedly large number of interaction networks are patterned in a non-random manner.

AB We studied biotic and abiotic factors that influence pollination in two sympatric winter flowering species. Helleborus foetidus and Helleborus bocconei flower simultaneously in winter. Although climatic conditions are not favorable for biotic pollination both species rely mainly on large bees of the genus Bombus. At the beginning of flowering, harsh climatic conditions are restrictive for insect visits. As flowering continues and temperatures rise, pollinator activity increases. The two plant species share pollinators that visit them indiscriminately. The flowers of the two species differ in form and insects visit H. foetidus by inserting their heads and H. bocconei ventrally: pollen load on insects is highly specialized. With the arrival of spring, many other species start to bloom and in spite of the large number of flowers still on the plants insects abandon Helleborus species. At the end of spring increasing biotic interactions take away pollinators from the Helleborus species. (C) 2010 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB Climate warming causes range shifts of many species toward higher latitudes and altitudes. However, range shifts of host species do not necessarily proceed at the same rates as those of their enemies and symbionts. Here, we examined how a range shifting plant species performs in soil from its original range in comparison with soil from the expansion range. Tragopogon dubius is currently expanding from southern into northwestern Europe and we examined how this plant species responds to soil communities from its original and expansion ranges. We compared the performance of T. dubius with that of the closely related Tragopogon pratensis, which has a natural occurrence along the entire latitudinal gradient. Inoculation with the rhizosphere soil from T. dubius populations of the original range had a more negative effect on plant biomass production than inoculation with rhizosphere soil from the expansion range. Interestingly, the nonrange expander T. pratensis experienced a net negative soil effect throughout this entire range. The effects observed in this species pair may be due to release from soil born enemies or accumulation of beneficial soil born organisms. If this phenomenon applies broadly to other species, then range expansion may enable plants species to show enhanced performance.

AB The integration of community ecology into the understanding and management of vectors and vector-borne diseases has largely occurred only recently. This compendium examines a variety of community interactions that can affect vector or vector-borne disease dynamics. They include: the importance of risk of predation, risk of ectoparasatism, competition, interactions of competition with transgenic control, apparent competition mediated through vectors, indirect effects of pesticides, vector diversity, and parasite diversity within a vector. In this paper, we summarize these studies and introduce several additional important questions in need of further exploration.

AB Malaria, a mosquito-vectored disease, continues to be one of the most important scourges afflicting humankind. In this paper, we take a mosquito-centric approach by studying mosquito states (i.e., energy, neurological health, and toxin information state) to demonstrate how key parameters of malaria, biting and movement rates and mosquito survival, are all emergent properties of those states when considered in the context of the background community interactions. We do so as follows: First, we develop a dynamic state variable model of mosquito biting and movement decisions that maximize mosquito expected reproductive success (fitness), and then we embed those optimal policies in a Monte Carlo simulation wherein mosquitoes attempt to feed on human hosts at domiciles where insecticide-treated bednets (ITNs) and insecticidal residual wall sprays (IRSs) are used. We find that biting rates, at the domicile level, are not impacted by mosquito state but that emigration rates from domiciles are determined by an interaction between mosquito energy state, information state, and risk of predation. This means that malaria incidence, at the village level at least, may be best understood as a response of mosquitoes to their ecological community that includes nectar-bearing plants, predators, the spatial arrangement of homes, and the protection of humans in those homes.

AB The control of insect vectors through conventional sterile insect or transgenic technologies (e.g., RIDL (R)) is an intense focus of research in the combat against vector-borne disease. While the population dynamic implications of these control strategies are reasonably well-established, the effects of interspecific competition between different vectors and control strategies have not previously been explored. Different control intervention methods can affect the interaction and potential coexistence of vector species. By altering the shape of the zero net growth isoclines, conventional and transgenic control can affect patterns of vector coexistence and/or exclusion through Allee effects and transient dynamics. Further, transgenic control methods can mediate coexistence between target and non-target species and this can have important consequences for the persistence of disease and community ecological interactions.

AB Infectious disease influences the dynamics of host populations and the structure of species communities via impacts on host demography. Species that share infectious diseases are well-known to interact indirectly through the process of apparent competition, but there has been little attention given to the role of vectors in these indirect interactions. Here we explore how vector-borne disease and host-vector interactions can drive apparent competitive interactions. We show that different facets of the ecology associated with vector-host-host interactions affect the structure of the three-species assemblage. Crucially, the patterns associated with invasion of alternative hosts, the spread of the infectious disease by the vector, and the dynamics of the community interactions are influenced by the mode of transmission. We highlight the role of alternative hosts on disease amplification, dilution and magnification and discuss the results with reference to recent developments in apparent competition and community structure.

AB We describe how pesticides used for mosquito control alter communities in mosquito breeding sites, and how these alterations affect larval populations of mosquitoes. Lethal and sublethal toxic effects modify biological interactions through density- and trait-mediated changes. Density-mediated effects due to pesticide treatment can lead to indirect positive effects on the target species. For example, recolonization of pests can be amplified due to disturbances of antagonistic species. Trait-mediated effects can result in lethal effects of originally sublethal exposure when the pesticide is combined with additional stress. Such lethal effects can result from changes of behavior or sensitivity. Also the immune capacity and resistance of individuals to parasitic infection could be decreased. Furthermore, pesticide treatment can act independently of toxic effects. For example, habitat and oviposition site selection can be influenced. These examples highlight the diversity of processes to be considered when determining the overall consequences of pesticide treatment. We show that a better understanding of these processes is needed to predict effects of pesticides on population dynamics. Such knowledge would have direct benefits in designing mosquito control strategies.

TI Variation in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi colonization modifies the

AB P>1. Plant association with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) has been considered a factor increasing plant tolerance to herbivory. However, this positive effect could decrease with colonization density if the benefit : cost ratio of the AMF-plant association changes. We measured plant performance and tolerance to defoliation across a gradient of commercial AMF (Glomus sp.) inoculum concentration.
   2. Six genetic families of Datura stramonium were grown under greenhouse conditions and subjected to five increasing levels of AMF inoculum concentration and to defoliation treatments, i.e. the presence/absence of 50% artificial damage, following a full-factorial design.
   3. AMF colonization increased linearly with inoculum concentration while foliar area, root mass, flowering phenology and seed production expressed nonlinear functions. Plant genetic variation in the benefit function of AMF colonization was also detected. We show a negative interaction between AMF concentration and plant tolerance to defoliation.
   4. Synthesis. The negative correlation between plant tolerance and AMF concentration suggests that defoliation can reduce AMF benefits and that natural variations in AMF can limit the evolution of optimum levels of tolerance. Moreover, genetic variation in the shape of the reaction norms to AMF in the presence/absence of defoliation suggests that plants may evolve in response to variation in densities of AMF and herbivores.

AB New Caledonia is among Earth's biodiversity hotspots, and we are far from knowing how many species it sustains. We applied DNA-based methods for quick biodiversity assessment of New Caledonian Arsipoda flea beetles, enhancing the discovery and description of new species. Mitochondrial DNA phylogenetic analysis (cox1, rrnS) for four out of five known neocaledonian taxa hints at the existence of additional species, and two are confirmed and described based on morphology: Arsipoda geographica Gomez-Zurita sp. nov. and Arsipoda rostrata Gomez-Zurita sp. nov. Timing this small radiation using standard insect mitochondrial substitution rates places its origin in the Miocene. A DNA-based approach to investigate potential food plants for these herbivorous insects reveals associations with Myrsinaceae and Ericaceae, which have not yet been found in New Caledonia, suggesting that this indirect methodology may help in discovering undetected flora. Traditional taxonomy and molecular approaches cooperate here, boosting our knowledge on species inventory and ecological interactions where it is most needed.

FX Kjell-Arne Johanson (NRM, Stockholm, Sweden) and Christine Pollabauer
   (ERBIO, Noumea, Nouvelle-Caledonie) generously offered half of the
   samples of New Caledonian Arsipoda used in the phylogenetic analyses,
   and Lars Hendrich (ZSM, Munchen, Germany) contributed the specimen of
   Australian Arsipoda used as the outgroup. Shepherd Myers (Bishop Museum,
   Honolulu, HI, USA) kindly provided photographs of Samuelson's New
   Caledonian types to confirm identifications. Herve Jourdan (IRD, Noumea,
   Nouvelle-Caledonie), Gael Kergoat and Laurent Soldati (INRA,
   Montferrier-sur-Lez, France) shared difficult times with one of us
   (JAJR) at the Mt Kouakoue, the type locality of A. geographica
   Gomez-Zurita sp. nov., and Alain Queval, helicopter pilot, made it
   possible to reach this collecting site and, after several days, to
   return home safely amidst very bad weather conditions. The advice of
   Ignacio Ribera (IBE, Barcelona, Spain) helped us to improve this work in
   many respects. This project was funded by a Research Grant (no. 8380-07)
   of the Committee of Research and Exploration of the National Geographic
   Society, and also benefited from a travel grant from the Percy Sladen
   Memorial Fund of the Linnean Society of London.

AB The ecological effects of logging in the tropics have been analysed largely in terms of its impacts on species diversity and abundance. However. information is very limited regarding the impact. of logging oil ecological processes such as species interactions. Here we hypothesize that timber extraction per se. that is, in the absence of hunting. affects the abundance of the frugivorous Spicier monkey, Ateles geoffroyi, and that this has indirect effects on the recruitment of a predominant tree species, Manilkara zapota. and the diversity of the understorey plant community. Bale compared logged and unlogged sites, using a paired design. In each management, condition we conducted line transects and interviews to evaluate spicier monkey abundance and game preferences, respectively. Impact on plant recruitment and understorey diversity were evaluated using 2 x 2-m plots (N = 320) established Under 40 M. zapota tree crowns. No spider monkeys were recorded in logged sites whereas they were abundant (15 +/- 8 individuals per man-km) in unlogged sites. Interviews showed that spider monkeys are not hunted by local inhabitants. Logging was correlated witha a reduction of the number of M. zapota fruits used by A. geoffroyi: an increase in the number of sites dominated by M. zapota: and a reduction in understorey plant diversity. Our results suggest that the absence of A. geoffroyi in logged sites call indirectly impact plant recruitment and diversity via the disruption of plant-frugivore interactions. Further work is needed to assess if these effects persist over the long term, to define if logging operations affect, the overall diversity of tropical forests.

AB Forest edges often have increased species richness and abundance (edge effect) and affect spatial behaviors of species and dynamics of species interactions. Landscapes of intensively managed pine (Pinus spp.) stands are characterized by a mosaic of patches and linear forest edges. Managed pine forests are a primary landscape feature of the southeastern United States, but the effects of intensive management on bat communities are poorly understood. Insectivorous bats are important top predators in nocturnal forest food webs. We examined bat foraging behavior along forest edges and in 4 structurally distinct stand types (open-canopy pine, prethinned pine, thinned pine, and unmanaged forest) within a managed pine forest in the coastal plain of North Carolina, USA. During May-August, 2006 and 2007, we recorded echolocation calls using Pettersson D240X bat detectors linked to digital recorders at 156 sites. We also sampled nocturnal flying insects at each site using Malaise insect traps. We used negative binomial count regression models to describe bat foraging behavior relative to forest edges, stand types, and prey availability. Although some species showed affinities for certain stand types and prey items, bat activity patterns were most strongly related to forest edges. Edges were used extensively by 6 aerial-hunting bat species, but avoided by Myotis species. Forest edges function similarly to natural forest gaps, by providing foraging opportunities for aerial-hunting bat species. Therefore, the maintenance of forest edges in managed pine landscapes may enhance foraging habitat for aerial-hunting bat species.

AB Habitat edges can alter population dynamics, influence community structure, determine the success of conservation efforts, and facilitate the spread of invasive species. Despite recognition that edges influence the nature and strength of ecological interactions, edges are generally characterized using abiotic measures that likely capture habitat quality for only the focal taxa, and ignore the potential for biotic interactions to explain edge effects. Here we describe the association between edges and the density of an invasive shrub, Lonicera maackii, and infer the functional role of edges by using multiple criteria to weight edge contrast. We define edge contrast using both an abiotic criterion in which contrast is weighted by differences in light availability, and a biotic criterion in which edge contrast is weighted by the association between edges and the abundance of the American Robin (Turdus migratorius), an important avian seed disperser. Biotically defining edge contrast significantly improved model fit in all cases, demonstrating that the large-scale distribution of an invasive shrub is best predicted using both abiotic and biotic edge characterization. More generally, our work suggests that weighting edge contrast using key biological interactions in addition to abiotic criteria may be a promising way to understand the multiple pathways by which edges influence the distribution and abundance of organisms.

AB Imagery and environmental data from 7 diffuse flow hydrothermal vent sites along the Eastern Lau Spreading Center (ELSC) are used to constrain the effects of lava type, temperature, chemistry, and biological interactions on faunal distributions. Of the species with chemoautotrophic endosymbionts, the snail Alviniconcha spp. occupies habitats with the greatest exposure to vent fluids. Temperatures exceeding 45 degrees C define its upper limit of exposure to vent flow, and minimum sulfide requirements constrain its lower limits. The mussel Bathymodiolus brevior experiences the least exposure to vent flow; temperatures of about 20 degrees C determine its upper limit, while its lower limit is defined by its minimum sulfide requirements. The snail Ifremeria nautilei inhabits areas with intermediate exposure to vent fluids and biological interactions are likely the most important factor shaping this snail's realized niche. Microhabitats of non-symbiont-containing fauna were defined in terms of symbiont-containing faunal distributions. The crab Austinograea spp. occupies areas with the greatest exposure to vent flow; shrimp, the snail Eosipho desbruyeresi, and anemones inhabit intermediate zones of vent flow; and the squat lobster Munidopsis lauensis dominates the periphery of diffuse flow areas, with little exposure to vent fluids. The physical structure of different lava types along the ELSC differentially affects the diffusion of vent fluids, which has a variety of implications for fauna, particularly distributions of zoanthids, anemones, and mixed communities of I. nautilei and B. brevior.

AB Physical processes play an important role in structuring predator-prey interactions by influencing the abundance, distribution and behaviour of prey. Many biological hotspots are associated with ocean currents, fronts and eddies, as a result of their predictability as a prey source. In this study, we determined the effect of topography, tidal currents and fronts on the movements and behaviour of a marine top predator, the bottlenose dolphin Tursiops truncatus, within a known foraging area in the Moray Firth, Scotland. Three main fronts were identified and characterised. Dolphins concentrated their search effort in close proximity to these small-scale fronts. Areas with steep seabed gradients were also preferred, but different sites were used depending on the direction of the current, indicating an effect of topography on hydrodynamics and predator-prey interactions. The mean swimming speed over ground for all dolphin tracks (n = 26) was 1.15 m s(-1), but their mean speed through the water was higher (2.18 m s(-1)). This is close to the most energetically efficient swimming speed for bottlenose dolphins. On average, the dolphins therefore appeared to be expending minimal energy during movement. These results suggest that the interaction between topography and hydrography provided a mechanism for improving foraging success and/or efficiency for the bottlenose dolphin. The narrowness of the channel may concentrate prey and the presence of topographically controlled fronts may further increase the availability of prey, as well as its predictability. Marine predators can focus their foraging efforts on such locations to improve efficiency and reduce energetic costs.

AB Few studies have analysed the depth distribution of marine zooplankton at high-resolution, and knowledge obtained from theoretical modelling studies predominates over that from empirical field studies. We analysed depth selection by the marine copepod Calanus finmarchicus during spring and summer in neritic and oceanic Subarctic regions. Data on hydrography and zooplankton distribution in the upper 100 m were collected at high resolution by a towed instrument platform equipped with CTD, fluorometer and an optical plankton counter. Four extensive field data sets covering time windows from 3 to 11 d during the productive season were analysed using generalized additive mixed models. Our main findings were that: (1) mean depth of older development stages (CV and adults) of C. finmarchicus was best predicted by biotic factors (depth of the fluorescence maximum and population density), while abiotic factors (depth of the pycnocline) were of secondary importance, (2) depth selection was similar in neritic and oceanic areas, and (3) there was no evidence for synchronous diel vertical migration. Our results suggest that copepods dynamically and consistently select their habitat (depth) based on food conditions and predators in a density-dependent manner. We conclude that ecological interactions may drive habitat choice of planktonic organisms even in highly fluctuating oceanic environments.

AB The impact of moderate environmental stress may be modulated by stress-induced shifts of biotic interactions such as host-epibiont relationships. We studied the stress regime in shallow Western Baltic habitats, the variability of fouling at different temporal and spatial scales, and whether common stressors-low light, high temperature and grazing-affect the abundance and composition of the biofilm on a regionally important macroalga, the bladder wrack Fucus vesiculosus. We further explored the alga's capacity to chemically modulate the recruitment of microfoulers and analyzed whether this ability is impacted by stress. In laboratory, mesocosm and field experiments, fouling pressure and epibiotic cover on the alga varied strongly with changing environmental conditions such as temperature, irradiance, depth and grazing. The expectation that abiotic stress affects the fouling-modulating ability of the alga and thus indirectly produces the observed variability of epibiosis was not generally confirmed. Indeed, while the strength of chemical antifouling resistance varied seasonally, with a maximum in winter-spring and a minimum in late summer, this could not be related to temporal patterns of environmental stress, fouling pressure, or growth of F. vesiculosus. Only the seasonal variation in reproduction seemed to be in phase with antifouling activity. Controlled experiments confirmed that resistance strength was not affected by temperature or grazing, and only moderately by light. We conclude that the fouling modulation ability of F. vesiculosus may suffer from light reduction (e. g. by eutrophication effects), but is not sensitive to predicted warming or enhanced grazing.

AB Changes in species abundances caused by climatic variability have long been linked to alterations in community composition, species interactions and maintenance of biodiversity in marine ecosystems. Here we use multivariate regression tree (MRT) analyses to quantify how changes in species abundances and environmental variability contributed to observed patterns of community composition in the Gulf of St. Lawrence during 2 contrasting periods (the cooler and less saline period 1991 to 1995 and the warmer and more saline period 1997 to 2003). Broad-scale patterns of community composition in both periods were consistently explained by the depth and salinity of the benthic environment, but biological factors differed. In the cold period, the previous year's catches of snow crab Chionoecetes opilio and northern shrimp (mainly Pandalus borealis) were most important, while in the warm period the previous year's catch of Atlantic cod Gadus morhua dominated. MRT models further identified spatially discrete areas where communities are characterized by relatively high abundances of these species. These results indicate that environmental variability leads to dynamic and spatially explicit responses not only of single species, but of marine communities. Applications of ecosystem management in the face of climate change must take this into account.

AB Previous studies on trait-mediated trophic interactions in marine ecosystems were restricted to pair-wise interactions between one species of meso-herbivore and plant, though multi-grazer interactions are more common in nature. We investigated whether the feeding of one consumer, either the periwinkle Littorina littorea or the isopod Idotea baltica, affected consumption by the other consumer via anti-herbivory defence induction in the brown seaweed Fucus vesiculosus. To test the generality of our findings, we ran similar experiments with seaweed/grazer populations in the North and Baltic Seas (NE Atlantic). Grazer-specificity in induction strength was assessed by using the same species of grazer for induction and consumption. 'Indirect' induction effects were assessed by using different species of grazers for induction and consumption. Palatability assays were run with live algae and with reconstituted food to distinguish between different mechanisms of resistance. Grazing by herbivores induced a chemical defence in F. vesiculosus. In the North Sea population, the induced defences were only effective against I. baltica, regardless of inducer identity. The sensitive responses of I. baltica to the induced defences were also detected in the reconstituted food assays using Baltic Sea organisms. Thus, marine meso-grazers may be affected by previous feeding through the same or a different species of consumer by modified prey traits, such as induced chemical defences. Furthermore, the magnitude of the effect in the induced defences can be determined by species-specific sensitivity.

AB Post-release adaptation and stocking effectiveness of a highly depleted pleuronectid flatfish, spotted halibut Verasper variegatus, were assessed in Miyako Bay, Japan. In early July 2004 and 2005, 22 000 and 5000 hatchery-reared juveniles (mean 81.2 and 89.8 mm total length, respectively) were released in shallow waters in the inner bay area. Results from surveys with a 2 m beam-trawl conducted over a 2 mo post-release period, laboratory predation experiments using potential predators (age-1 Japanese flounder), and a market census continued until December 2008, suggested that released juveniles, which had a size refuge from predators, could quickly adapt to brackish water habitats where there were suitable physical conditions (temperature, salinity and sediments) and abundant prey organisms. Juveniles selectively preyed on epibenthic gammarids and cumaceans, and had full stomachs 1 wk after release. Some released fish grew to >40 cm by age-1+, feeding exclusively on larger crustaceans (e. g. isopods, carideans and brachyurans). Market census revealed that released fish showed >99% contribution to catches, and recapture rates for fish released in 2004 (7.6%) and 2005 (15.7%) were higher than for releases in 2000 to 2003 (0.7 to 5.0%), possibly due to the development and application of improved release strategies (i.e. release habitat, size and season was appropriate in 2004 and 2005). Our study demonstrates that (1) local depleted stocks can be effectively restored by hatchery releases and that (2) development of release strategies based on the analysis of ecological interactions between released juveniles and the target ecosystem can largely contribute to the successful restocking of depleted species.

AB Evidence of species interactions are generally well understood over broad temporal and spatial scales, particularly for commercially valuable species. Yet species that are not as commercially valuable may nonetheless be ecologically important in stabilizing trophic interactions in large marine ecosystems. We examined the diets for 4 of these demersal fish species: black sea bass Centropristis striata, scup Stenotomus chrysops, Northern searobin Prionotus carolinus, and striped searobin P. evolans. We examined food habits data across size class, season, 5 yr time block, and geographic region to evaluate the major determinants of diet composition. We used multivariate statistics, specifically canonical correspondence analysis, as the primary method to explore diet determinants. Our results showed that the scup and 2 searobin species are primarily benthivorous, whereas black sea bass notably shifts towards piscivory with ontogeny. Our results also showed that the diet of these predators was mainly influenced by size class, region, and (to a lesser extent) season, whereas 5 yr time block did not notably influence diet composition, a surprising observation given the well-documented changes to benthic habitat in this ecosystem. These results suggest that these species feed opportunistically in proportion to the relative abundance of available prey given the constraints of their morphology, which implies that despite notable impacts to benthic habitat, the prey field for these understudied species has been consistent (within seasonal variation) over the past 3 decades. Stable feeding dynamics such as these may act to enhance resilience in large marine ecosystems.

AB Some studies have shown that the balance between top-down and bottom-up processes is context dependent, but few have tested how biotic interactions can affect this balance. We quantified the attack frequencies by the stem borer moth Haimbachia sp. nov. on the cordgrasses Spartina densiflora and S. alterniflora in 5 marshes of the southwestern Atlantic coastline, located between 36 degrees S and 41 degrees S. We examined whether ecosystem engineering by burrowing crabs Neohelice (Chasmagnathus) granulata, which improves plant performance, increases herbivory incidence by moths. The results show that moths attack an important proportion of Spartina spp. sterns (4% to 26 %). Moth attack frequencies were higher on low elevation than on high elevation marsh plants, probably clue to variations in plant performance across the physical stress gradient. Within marshes, burrowing crab densities and moth attack frequencies were positively correlated, suggesting that ecosystem engineering by crabs may increase moth attacks. Field experiments confirmed this prediction and suggest that the effect of crabs on moth attacks may be driven by nutrient availability. Our results show that stem-boring herbivores can cause significant plant mortality in Spartina spp. marshes, and that ecosystem engineering by burrowing crabs increases this effect. Thus, in this system, biotic factors that improve plant performance lead to an increase in herbivory control.

AB Niche variation is a widespread phenomenon that has important implications for ecological interactions and conservation biology, but few studies have quantified the trophic niche width (TNW) and its within- and between-individual components. We used stable isotopes of body feathers to investigate (1) seasonal isotopic niche changes of 4 southern procellariiforms and, (2) the level to which individuals are specialised relative to their population within each season. (1) delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of chicks and adults indicated a well-defined trophic segregation within the seabird assemblage during both the breeding and poorly known moulting (inter-nesting) periods, and they underlined marked species-specific seasonal changes. One species (light-mantled sooty albatross) remained within the Southern Ocean both during breeding and body feather moult, while the 3 others migrated either to oceanic subtropical waters (wandering and sooty albatrosses) or high isotopic marine areas (e.g. productive neritic waters; white-chinned petrel) during the moulting period. (2) Isotopic variances and TNW were generally low, indicating that birds belong to isotopic specialist populations within a given period. Variances and TNW were larger for white-chinned petrel chicks and light-mantled sooty albatross adults, respectively, indicating isotopic generalist populations and revealing 2 new foraging behaviours. Individual white-chinned petrel chicks segregated by their feather isotopic signatures, thus indicating individual/pair specialisation of parent birds during the chick-rearing period. The light-mantled sooty albatross population included mostly isotopic generalist individuals during the moulting period, with individuals using different habitats and diets. The study highlights the utility of feather isotopic signature for determining TNW and points out the necessity to develop such new approaches to better depict niche variations at both population and individual levels.

AB Native and exotic sessile invertebrates can act as habitat modifiers and influence the diversity and composition of associated epifaunal communities. Theory and empirical research predict that greater habitat structural complexity will generally result in higher abundance, richness, and diversity of epifaunal species. We evaluated the impact of a recently introduced, structurally complex bryozoan, Watersipora subtorquata, by comparing its associated epifaunal communities with those of primary substrate, other habitat modifiers (tunicates and mussels), and structurally similar mimics. Community composition differed between Watersipora and other treatments for both mobile and sessile epifaunal communities, but species richness and diversity were significantly higher on Watersipora for mobile animals only. Differences in mobile community composition and diversity were driven by polychaete worms, which were found in greater abundance and higher diversity in Watersipora. Crustaceans, although equally abundant, were more evenly distributed across treatments. Sessile epifaunal communities differed little in richness or abundance among treatments, suggesting that while Watersipora provides biogenic surfaces for colonization that adequately compensate for the primary substrate it exploits, its high structural complexity does not correspond to an increase in sessile epifaunal abundance relative to less complex habitat modifiers. Our results suggest that neutral or facilitative effects of exotic species may be common; the strength and direction of the impact of a novel habitat-forming species on epifaunal communities will depend on the quality of the resource it provides, the strength of ecological interactions between habitat-forming species and epifauna, epifaunal habitat preferences, and whether habitat is a limiting resource for a particular species or group.

AB The different abilities of plant species to use ephemeral or permanent water sources strongly affect physiological performance and species coexistence in water-limited ecosystems. In addition to withstanding drought, plants in coastal habitats often have to withstand highly saline soils, an additional ecological stress. Here we tested whether observed competitive abilities and C-water relations of two interacting shrub species from an arid coastal system were more related to differences in root architecture or salinity tolerance. We explored water sources of interacting Juniperus phoenicea Guss. and Pistacia lentiscus L. plants by conducting physiology measurements, including water relations, CO2 exchange, photochemical efficiency, sap osmolality, and water and C isotopes. We also conducted parallel soil analyses that included electrical conductivity, humidity, and water isotopes. During drought, Pistacia shrubs relied primarily on permanent salty groundwater, while isolated Juniperus plants took up the scarce and relatively fresh water stored in upper soil layers. As drought progressed further, the physiological activity of Juniperus plants nearly stopped while Pistacia plants were only slightly affected. Juniperus plants growing with Pistacia had stem-water isotopes that matched Pistacia, unlike values for isolated Juniperus plants. This result suggests that Pistacia shrubs supplied water to nearby Juniperus plants through hydraulic lift. This lifted water, however, did not appear to benefit Juniperus plants, as their physiological performance with co-occurring Pistacia plants was poor, including lower water potentials and rates of photosynthesis than isolated plants. Juniperus was more salt sensitive than Pistacia, which withstood salinity levels similar to that of groundwater. Overall, the different abilities of the two species to use salty water appear to drive the outcome of their interaction, resulting in asymmetric competition where Juniperus is negatively affected by Pistacia. Salt also seems to mediate the interaction between the two species, negating the potential positive effects of an additional water source via hydraulic lift.

AB Earthworms are used in an increasing number of microcosm experiments that investigate their behaviour and biology or that consider earthworms an environmental factor that influences soil properties and biological interactions. However, there exists no standardized protocol for performing comparable studies. After giving a short overview of the different experimental approaches using earthworms as model organisms, the present paper provides recommendations for the planning and execution of earthworm experiments that help in achieving comparable results. The recommendations, Summarized in a workflow diagram, pertain to the acquisition, treatment and description of earthworms for experimentation, the description and preparation of test soils and the criteria that should be met for valid experimental results.

AB Positive interactions are hypothesized to increase with stress (stress-gradient hypothesis, "SGH"), which is defined in terms of standing biomass at the community level. However, recent evidence suggests that facilitation may decrease or remain constant as stress increases. Several reasons for this discrepancy are possible: (i) the outcomes of biotic interactions depend on the component of the fitness considered; (ii) they are influenced by how vegetation affects local limiting resources; (iii) within a particular community, only species that are deviated from their physiological optima are likely to be facilitated. In a removal experiment, we quantified the deviations of species in subalpine grassland from their physiological optima, defined here as species-level "strain", and examined whether strain and vegetation effects on local resources can explain the outcome of biotic interactions. The experiment was performed along a gradient of standing biomass driven by contrasting land use and resource availability, and used five grass species with contrasting traits and ecological optima. Strain for each species was estimated by comparing growth without vegetation (target species only submitted to local abiotic factors) to growth in optimal conditions (under controlled conditions in an experimental garden). The outcomes of biotic interactions, recorded in terms of survival and growth, Could be predicted from the data about strain and vegetation effects on local limiting resources (light and water). Only highly strained species were affected by facilitation, which occurred when the surrounding vegetation alleviated the constraining factors. On the other hand, standing biomass was poorly related with the outcomes of biotic interactions. The "SGH" was only partially validated with growth data when strain and vegetation effects co-varied with standing biomass. As a consequence, strain (at species level) represents a mechanistic basis which could improve the prediction of the outcomes of biotic interactions along ecological gradients.

AB Human-mediated nutrient amendments have widespread effects on plant communities. One of the major consequences has been the loss of species diversity under increased nutrient inputs. The loss of species can be functional group dependent with certain functional groups being more prone to decline than others. We present results from the sixth year of a long-term fertilization and litter manipulation study in an old-field grassland. We measured plant tissue chemistry (C:N ratio) to understand the role of plant physiological responses in the increase or decline of functional groups under nutrient manipulations. Fertilized plots had significantly more total aboveground biomass and live biomass than unfertilized plots, which was largely due to greater productivity by exotic C-3 grasses. We found that both fertilization and litter treatments affected plant species richness. Species richness was lower on plots that were fertilized or had litter intact; species losses were primarily from forbs and non-Poaceae graminoids. C-3 grasses and forbs had lower C:N ratios under fertilization with forbs having marginally greater %N responses to fertilization than grasses. Tissue chemistry in the C-3 grasses also varied depending on tissue type with reproductive tillers having higher C:N ratios than vegetative tillers. Although forbs had greater tissue chemistry responses to fertilization, they did not have a similar positive response in productivity and the number of forb species is decreasing on our experimental plots. Overall, differential nutrient uptake and use among functional groups influenced biomass production and species interactions, favoring exotic C-3 grasses and leading to their dominance. These data suggest functional groups may differ in their responses to anthropogenic nutrient amendments, ultimately influencing plant community composition.

AB Ecological stoichiometry is the study of the balance of multiple chemical elements in ecological interactions. Terrestrial plants exhibit inter- and intra-specific differences in leaf C:N:P stoichiometry that has been used to study plant competition and succession, nutrient use efficiency N and P nutrient limitation. However, little is known about leaf C:N ratio, N:P ratio in the Loess Plateau, particularly the pattern of leaf C:N:P stoichiometry during the secondary succession. Thus, leaf stoichiometric traits and specific leaf area (SLA) of dominant species at different secondary successional stages in the Loess Plateau were measured. The study was conducted at the Lianjiabian forest region of the Loess Plateau (35.03 degrees-36.37 degrees N and 108.10 degrees-109.08 degrees E), Gansu, China. Leaf C:N:P stoichiometry and specific leaf area of 18 dominant species (herb) community stage (Stipa bungeana Trin, Bothriochloa ischaemun (Linn.) Keng, Carex lanceolata Boott, Artemisia sacrorurn Ledeb, Pulsatilla chinensis (Bunge) Regel, Potentilla chinensis Ser), shrub community stage (Sophora viciifolia Hance, Hippophae rhamnoides (Linn.), Ostryopsis davidiana Decne, Rubus palmatus Thunb, Rosa xanthina Lindl, Acer ginnala Maxim, Spiraea pubescens Turcz, Ziziphus jujuba var. spinosa), early forest community stage (Populus davidiana Dode, Betula platyphylla Suk, Platycladus orientalis (Linn.) Franco), climax forest community stage (Quercus liaotungensis Koidz)) at four secondary successional stages were determined in the Loess Plateau in early June of 2006.
   The herb and shrub community stage had higher SLA than that in the early forest community stage and climax forest community stage. The Leaf C, N, C:N ratio and N:P ratio at different secondary successional stages were significantly different (P <0.05), but the leaf P didn't differ. The N:P ratio of herb community stage were significant difference from those of the others stages (shrub community stage, early forest community stage and climax forest community stage), but there were not significant difference among the shrub community stage, early forest community stage and climax forest community stage. N:P ratio shifts of the species were consistent along the successional sere, although the N:P ratio of the different species at a successional stage varied considerably. On community level, the lowest N:P ratio (9.8) was found in herb community stage in the secondary succession, the N:P ratio increased to 12.9 in shrub community stage, declined to 12.4 in early forest community stage, and increased in climax forest community stage (e.g. 12.6 in the Quercus liaotungensis Koidz community). The results suggest that the vegetation productivity of the Loess Plateau was N-limited at each secondary successional stage.

AB It is well known that the similarity in species composition between two communities decays with the geographic distance that separates them. It is thus likely that the similarity in the dynamics of two communities also decays with distance, because the distance-decay relationship is fundamental in nature. However, the distance-decay relationships of community dynamics have not yet been revealed. We used transition matrix models to evaluate distance-decay relationships of seasonal community dynamics (from spring to summer) in rocky intertidal sessile assemblages along the Pacific coast of Japan between 31A degrees N and 43A degrees N. We evaluated the distance-decay relationships of whole-community dynamics and of three dynamics-related components-recruitment, disturbance, and species interaction (competition and facilitation)-for communities separated by distances ranging from several meters to thousands of kilometers. The similarity of the recruitment dynamics among communities declined rapidly with distance within the fine spatial scale, but only moderately within larger scales. The similarity of the disturbance dynamics was independent of distance, and the similarity of species interaction declined slightly with increasing distance. The similarity of whole-community dynamics declined rapidly with distance at a fine spatial scale and moderately at larger scales. The fact that the distance-decay relationship of whole-community dynamics was similar to that of recruitment may suggest that recruitment processes are the most important determinant of spatial variability of community dynamics at our study sites during the study period.

AB Many studies indicated that saliva from herbivores might be involved in plant growth responses when plants have been grazed. However, there is currently no general agreement on whether saliva can affect plant growth. Our aims were to determine the growth response of plants to sheep saliva after defoliation under diverse environmental conditions (different sward structures), and whether the effect of saliva is influenced by time (duration) after its application. We conducted field experiments with clipping treatments and the application of sheep saliva to the damaged parts of tillers to simulate sheep grazing on the perennial grass Leymus chinensis (Trin.) Tzvelev during the early growing seasons. Results demonstrated that clipping with saliva application significantly increased tiller numbers 8 weeks after treatments in comparison with clipping alone. A key finding is that the effect of sheep saliva on plant growth was short-lived. Clipping with saliva application increased leaf weight in the second week, while clipping alone had no effect. Moreover, clipping with saliva application promoted the elongation of new leaves (not the old ones) in the first week whereas clipping alone was ineffective. Results also showed that there were no differences between clipping with saliva application and clipping alone for relative height growth rate and aboveground biomass. Therefore, we concluded that saliva application to clipping treatment would produce an additional effect compared to clipping alone for the plant and the positive effects are time dependent. The additional effects primarily embodied in the individual level of plant, such as the changes of leaf weight and leaf length. Beyond the level, the effects of saliva only produced many more tiller numbers rather than the accumulation of aboveground biomass.

TI Escape of farmed tilapiines into the wild and entry of wild forms in
   fishponds, and the possible interactions between wild and farmed
   tilapiines from a sample of smallholder farms in Central Uganda

AB Seven smallholder fishponds in central Uganda were studied between 2000 and 2001 to investigate the interaction of farmed tilapiines with their wild conspecifics. Emphasis was on the features that facilitate escape of fish and/or entry of fish into the farms and interactions between the farmed and the wild. These included number of species, source of seed, connection between pond and natural watercourses, purpose of the farm, destination of cultured fish and interaction between farmed and wild fish. Fishponds had no screens against entry of wild fish into the farm or escape of farmed fish into the wild and occurred within wetlands close to natural watercourses. Ponds stocked with one fish species were found to have multispecies with some individuals that were apparently intermediate morphs between the species. Fry produced within the growout fishponds was shared with other farmers within and outside the watersheds. This study showed that smallholder farms with little or no control of escape or entry of fish out and into the fishponds, and little or no management present circumstances that facilitate continued movement of tilapiines within and across watersheds in Ugandan waters. The study also indicated possible genetic interaction between farmed and their wild conspecifics through interactions within fishponds.

AB Species richness is commonly thought to increase with habitat diversity. However, a recent theoretical model aiming to unify niche and island biogeography theories predicted a hump-shaped relationship between richness and habitat diversity. Given the contradiction between model results and previous knowledge, we examine whether the relationship between species richness and habitat diversity is consistently monotonically increasing and under which circumstances, if at all, such relationships could be hump shaped. We review the empirical evidence about the shape of such relationships and show that species richness on islands usually increases with habitat diversity and that it never decreases. We also critically examine the assumptions of the theoretical model and modify them to incorporate a less restrictive definition of niche width. The modified assumptions lead to simulations that better capture real patterns, using either simple parameters or observed distributions of niche breadth. Further work is needed to incorporate ecological interactions and metacommunity dynamics if the aim is to merge niche and island biogeography theories in a realistic modeling framework.

AB Anthropogenic activities usually trigger changes in the population density of plants. Thus, land management practices can influence density-dependent demographic parameters and species interactions. We investigated plant-pollinator interactions and reproduction in Prosopis flexuosa, the largest tree species in the Central Monte desert of Argentina, an important economic and cultural resource for humans and a functionally prominent species. We hypothesized that reproductive output of P. flexuosa would be limited at low densities, and that exclusion of catle grazing would enhance population density and consequently interaction frequency with pollinators and reproductive success. The study was conducted in and around Nacunan Biosphere Reserve (Mendoza, Argentina), where cattle grazing has been excluded for over 35 years. Working in five pairs of protected and cattle grazed 1-ha plots, we recorded density of adult trees, pollinator visitation frequency to inflorescences and seeds per inflorescence in focal trees. Adult tree density was higher in protected plots than in cattle grazed plots. Density of reproductive trees was positively correlated with seed production, suggesting positive density dependence for reproduction (Allee effect). Pollinator visitation to inflorescences and seed production was higher in protected plots compared with plots under cattle grazing. Suppression of anthropogenic degradation has resulted in higher adult tree density in protected plots, indirectly higher pollinator visitation to inflorescences and higher reproductive success of trees. Increased frequency of plant-pollinator interactions and tree reproduction suggest success of management practices aimed at protecting P. flexuosa woodlands.

AB The European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) is a conservation and social dilemma in the Canary Islands. It is the main prey of endangered species, it causes severe impacts on vegetation, as well as has a considerable hunting economic value but damages agriculture. We assessed drivers of European rabbit habitat selection on Fuerteventura Island (Canary Islands, Spain) in order to understand the ecology and to contribute with data for managing this introduced species. To measure rabbit abundance, we counted the total number of fresh pellets and latrines. We used Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) to analyze the relationship between rabbit abundance and four groups of variables that represented the biological requirements of the species (environmental, food resources, refuges/shelters, and biological interactions). Hierarchical partitioning techniques were used to estimate the explanatory capacity of these different groups of variables. Our model better explained fresh pellet abundance (89% of total deviance) than latrine abundance (57%). Variables related to food resources best explained the abundance of both latrines and pellets. We identified a set of plant species highly correlated with rabbit abundance, which probably makes up the species' diet. Variables relating to refuge/shelter and the environmental were also relevant. Interactions with other mammals did not strongly affect rabbit abundance on Fuerteventura Island. Mean annual precipitation and temperature were variables that individually best explained abundance, although half of their relevance is shared with others non-environmental variables. Our results provide policy makers and land-managers with applied information on the relationship between rabbit populations and micro-scale components of Fuerteventura.

AB Habitat fragmentation increases the temporal variability in species richness and abundance of forest birds. Therefore, changes in the ecological interactions at which birds are engaged might be transient. Furthermore, despite changes in insectivory rates might have cascading effects if such changes are permanent, there are no evaluations of the persistency of changes in insectivory rates. In this study, we assessed the persistency of changes in insectivory in forest fragments, comparing the intensity of insectivory upon artificial insect larvae at three different years at a single site in central Chile. In coastal Maulino forest, the intensity of insectivory is persistently higher in forest fragments compared to continuous forest. An increase in insectivory might reduce herbivorous insect abundance which is translated into higher growth rates in seedlings at forest fragments, a factor that is changing forest dynamics. Our study suggests that the variation in bird insectivory on fragmented forest is a permanent phenomenon, which might have profound implication for the dynamics of the forest remnants.

AB The accumulation and variability of ecdysteroids, which are analogs of the insect molting hormones, were studied during ontogeny of agricultural populations of Rhaponticum carthamoides (Leuzea carthamoides DC.) and Serratula coronata with relation to the plant age and cultivation conditions. The physiological role of ecdysteroids in the ecological interactions with pests was evaluated.
   It was found that the enhancement of herbivore activity coincided with biochemical changes in the composition of ecdysteroids having different physiological activities and was accompanied by damage to reproductive organs. During ontogenetic (age-related) changes and seasonal development in the vegetation season, the content of the physiologically active ecdysteroid 20-hydroxyecdysone decreased and relatively moderately active inokosterone and weakly active ecdysone were accumulated in reproductive shoots.
   Accumulation of the weakly active ecdysteroid ecdysone in phytomass is affected by environmental conditions and anthropogenic factors of cultivation. The factors contributing to the damage potential are environmental microclimate, relief features of population locations, and agrotechnical measures (frequency of phytomass removal, excessive moisture content in the rooting layer).

AB Climate variability, which is expected to increase in the future, can promote coexistence through a mechanism called the storage effect. Currently, we have little understanding of how the importance of the storage effect varies among ecosystems. We tested for the three conditions of the storage effect in a sagebrush steppe plant community in Idaho (USA) by combining long-term observational data with statistical models. The four sagebrush steppe species that we studied satisfied the first two conditions of the storage effect: a long-lived life stage and species-specific responses to the environment. But the critical third condition, environment-competition covariance, was very weak in this community. While the direction of the covariance was consistent with a stabilizing effect of variability (stronger competition in more favorable years), its magnitude was small, reflecting low temporal variability in both competition and species responses to the environment. Consistent with this result, simulations of species population growth rates when rare showed that climate variability had no consistent stabilizing effect on coexistence. This case study provides an important reminder that species-specific responses to the environment are not sufficient for coexistence via the storage effect. Instead, the magnitude of temporal variability in species performance also plays an important role. Comparison of our results with those from a similar study in Kansas mixed prairie suggests that temporal variability in species performance may reflect both the strength of environmental variability as well as life history strategies.

AB Community assembly theory asserts that the contemporary composition of ecological communities may depend critically on events that occur during the formation of the community; a phenomenon termed "historical contingence.'' We tested key aspects of this theory using plant communities in over 200 experimentally created vernal pools at a field site in central California, USA. The experiment was initiated in 1999 with construction of vernal pool basins into which different seeding treatments were imposed to evaluate the effects of dispersal limitation, order of colonization ("priority effects''), and frequency of colonization on plant community composition. We tracked the abundance and distribution of five focal species for seven years following seeding and observed strong but transient effects of seeding, as well as order and frequency of colonization. All five species occurred with higher frequency in seeded pools vs. unseeded control pools, demonstrating dispersal limitation. Three of four species exerted strong priority effects, with much higher abundance in pools in which they were seeded first compared to pools in which they were seeded in the second year of the study, one year after other species were seeded. We tested for effects of frequency of colonization using one species, the endangered Lasthenia conjugens, and observed much higher abundance in frequently vs. infrequently seeded pools for the first four years following seeding. Finally, we observed that the strength of priority effects varied significantly with water depth for one of the species groups, which demonstrates that abiotic context can strongly influence species interactions. We conclude that several aspects of historical contingence play key roles in the early formation of vernal pool plant communities. But we also observed reversals in community trajectories, suggesting that in this system historical effects may be lost within a decade.

AB The ability of miniscule larvae to control their fate and replenish populations in dynamic marine environments has been a long-running topic of debate of central importance for managing resources and understanding the ecology and evolution of life in the sea. Larvae are considered to be highly susceptible to offshore transport in productive upwelling regions, thereby increasing dispersal, limiting onshore recruitment, and reducing the intensity of community interactions. We show that 45 species of nearshore crustaceans were not transported far offshore in a recruitment-limited region characterized by strong upwelling. To the contrary, 92% of these larvae remained within 6 km from shore in high densities throughout development along two transects sampled four times during the peak upwelling season. Larvae of most species remained nearshore by remaining below a shallow Ekman layer of seaward-flowing surface waters throughout development. Larvae of other species migrated farther offshore by occurring closer to the surface early in development. Postlarvae evidently returned to nearshore adult habitats either by descending to shoreward-flowing upwelled waters or rising to the sea surface where they can be transported shoreward by wind relaxation events or internal waves. Thus wind-driven offshore transport should not limit recruitment, even in strong upwelling regions, and larvae are more likely to recruit closer to natal populations than is widely believed. This study poses a new challenge to determine the true cause and extent of recruitment limitation for a more diverse array of species along upwelling coasts, and thus to further advance our understanding of the connectivity, dynamics, and structure of coastal populations.

AB This experimental study tests new theory for multiple predator effects on communities by using warming to alter predator habitat use and hence direct and indirect interactions in a grassland food web containing two dominant spider predator species, a dominant grasshopper herbivore and grass and herb plants. Experimental warming further offers insight into how climate change might alter direct and indirect effects. Under ambient environmental conditions, spiders used habitat in spatially complementary locations. Consistent with predictions, the multiple predator effect on grasshoppers and on plants was the average of the individual predator effects. Warming strengthened the single predator effects. It also caused the spider species to overlap lower in the vegetation canopy. Consistent with predictions, the system was transformed into an intraguild predation system with the consequent extinction of one spider species. The results portend climate caused loss of predator diversity with important consequences for food web structure and function.

AB P>1. Leaf litter decomposition is one of the most important ecosystem processes in streams. Recent studies suggest that facilitation, in which litter is processed by a succession of species with differing abilities and requirements, may be important in making the nutrients bound in litter available to the stream assemblage.
   2. We predicted that stream invertebrates that feed on terrestrial leaf litter (shredders) and tadpoles would facilitate leaf litter decomposition by changing the quality of leaf material directly via physical contact or indirectly via nutrient release. We experimentally examined the ability of shredders and tadpoles to break down leaves, independently and together, in artificial streams beside a natural forest stream.
   3. The decomposition rate was greater when shredders and tadpoles were together than was expected from rates in single-species treatments, indicating that facilitation occurred. This facilitation operated in one direction only: the rate of leaf breakdown by tadpoles was higher when leaves had been partly processed by shredders, but there was no similar effect when leaves previously occupied by tadpoles were processed by shredders. We did not detect facilitation caused by indirect nutrient release.
   4. Shredders may have benefited tadpoles by roughening leaf surfaces, making them easier for the tadpoles to consume and enhancing leaf breakdown in the presence of both taxa. This indicates that the loss of a single species can have impacts on ecosystem functioning that go beyond the loss of its direct contribution.

AB P> Due to species-specificity of the outcomes of biotic interactions, it is difficult to generalize from observed biotic interactions at the individual plant level to the effect of those interactions at the community level. To evaluate the importance of biotic interactions in shaping plant communities, it is necessary to understand how the outcomes of the complex interactions observed at the individual level can influence community structure.
   Here, we propose a trait-based framework that identifies and organises mechanisms affecting community structure (here described with relative abundances of plant functional traits - i.e. the distribution of trait values at the community level). We applied our approach to a single leaf trait, specific leaf area (SLA), to link individual responses to plant interactions with community structure (SLA distribution observed at the community level) and to test whether biotic interactions can predict the functional composition of subalpine grasslands. We evaluated the generality of our model through a cross-validation with a set of eight subalpine grasslands independent from the four fields used to build the model.
   We found that competition and facilitation were able to explain the functional composition of subalpine grasslands, and the relevant fitness components (survival or growth) explaining this link changed depending on the limiting resources. When soil water availability was limiting, positive plant-plant interactions acting on survival were able to explain community structure. In contrast, when no water limitation was observed competition acting on individual growth was the main driver of community structure.
   Our framework enables evaluation of the consequences of biotic interactions observed at individual level on community structure, thereby indicating when and where different types of plant-plant interactions are important.

AB Global warming will affect all species but in largely unknown ways, with certain regions such as the Mediterranean Basin and its major islands including Sardinia being particularly vulnerable to desertification. Olive (Olea europaea) is of eco-social importance in the Mediterranean where it was domesticated. This drought-resistant crop and its major pest, the olive fly (Bactrocera oleae), have tight biological links that make them a suitable model system for climate change studies in the Mediterranean. Here a physiologically based weather-driven demographic model of olive and olive fly is used to analyze in detail this plant-pest system in Sardinia under observed weather (10 years of daily data from 48 locations), three climate warming scenarios (increases of 1, 2 and 3 degrees C in average daily temperature), and a 105-year climate model scenario for the Alghero location (e.g. 1951-2055). grass gis is used to map model predictions of olive bloom dates and yield, total season-long olive fly pupae, and percent fruit attacked by the fly. Island wide simulation data are summarized using multivariate regression. Model calibration with field bloom date data were performed to increase simulation accuracy of olive flowering predictions under climate change. As climate warms, the range of olive is predicted to expand to higher altitudes and consolidate elsewhere, especially in coastal areas. The range of olive fly will extend into previously unfavorable cold areas, but will contract in warm inland lowlands where temperatures approach its upper thermal limits. Consequently, many areas of current high risk are predicted to have decreased risk of fly damage with climate warming. Simulation using a 105-year climate model scenario for Alghero, Sardinia predicts changes in the olive-olive fly system expected to occur if climate continued to warm at the low rate observed during in the past half century.

AB P>1. Research in agricultural ecosystems is uncovering how the management of crop fields leads to the delivery of transgenic crop residues to adjacent waterways. Aquatic consumers encountering this material may be reduced in abundance and/or limit their feeding activity, subsequently altering organic matter breakdown rate, which is a key ecosystem process in streams.
   2. We investigated the effect of the transgenic nature of senesced corn (Zea mays L.), tissue on breakdown rates, invertebrate abundance and invertebrate community composition in nine streams draining agricultural fields over 2 years (2004-2006). We studied corn tissue modified to express protein toxins from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) from four hybrid families, each with its single, stacked and non-Bt near-isoline.
   3. In 2004, we identified two instances whereby Bt leaf litter degraded slower (67-68%) than corresponding near isolines. At one site this was associated with significantly fewer individuals of Pycnopsyche sp., a leaf-chewing caddisfly. In 2005-2006, no differences in breakdown were found between Bt and non-Bt near isolines. Multivariate analysis of invertebrate communities found no difference associated with Bt treatment.
   4. Principle components analysis identified important abiotic factors as explanatory variables influencing breakdown, but no interaction was found between these and Bt treatment. Breakdown was strongly related to total invertebrate abundance occurring on experimental litter bags, but this did not interact with Bt treatment across all hybrid x isoline x site combinations.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Ecological interactions facilitate breakdown of allochthonous detritus, and understanding the potential disruption of these interactions is important to the management of ecosystem processes. The results from our study suggests that corn tissue breakdown is unlikely to be altered by Bt, but more so by hybrid- and site-specific factors such as nutrients. Management of agricultural streams will need to consider multiple sources of stress at larger scales, such as nutrient loading and temperature, which probably overwhelm the potential for consumer mediation of ecosystem processes in these ecosystems.

AB Question
   As it has been found that stress promotes positive interactions mediated by physical amelioration of the environment, is it possible that interactions may turn positive with increasing chronic anthropogenic disturbance (CAD) intensity? Also, is it possible that species that do not tolerate disturbance may require environmental amelioration by their neighbours in disturbed areas, whereas tolerant species may not?
   Location
   The semi-arid grassland in Concepcion Buenavista, Oaxaca, southern Mexico.
   Methods
   We assessed interaction intensity and importance through a neighbour removal experiment along a CAD gradient for three species differing in disturbance tolerance. Water potential was monitored on vegetated and bare soil.
   Results
   A shift from competitive effects in low CAD sites to positive interactions in degraded sites was found. The disturbance-tolerant species did not respond to CAD, whereas the less tolerant species changed its interactions drastically in terms of growth and reproduction. The species with medium tolerance had an intermediate response. Neighbours promoted germination in all species. Vegetation removal reduced soil humidity.
   Conclusions
   Positive interactions seemingly resulted from the amelioration of the abiotic stresses induced by vegetation removal. The dependence on neighbours to germinate, grow, or reproduce suggests that if CAD eliminates the plant cover, vegetation will hardly recover. Irreversible changes are known to occur in communities where positive interactions predominate, but CAD may set the conditions for irreversible shifts even in communities where interactions are normally competitive.

AB Questions
   Fire appears to affect both replacement patterns and coexistence of Araucaria araucana-Nothofagus pumilio forests in the Andean Araucarian region of south-central Chile. A quantitative assessment of coexistence in the absence of recent fires, however, is lacking. In this study, we considered the life-history attributes, time of recruitment and spatial pattern of individuals of both tree species to address the following questions. How regular has recruitment of both species been in time? Is there any temporal niche differentiation? Are the two species positively or negatively associated in space and, if so, at what scale and for what age and size classes? Is there any spatial niche differentiation?
   Location
   Andean Araucarian region of Chile, Villarrica National Park (39 degrees 35'S, 71 degrees 31'W; 1300 m a.s.l.).
   Methods
   We stem-mapped and cored a total of 1073 trees in a 1-ha plot in a late-successional post-fire stand to examine spatiotemporal patterns of establishment. We used semivariogram modelling and the pair-correlation function to distinguish between regeneration modes and describe species interactions.
   Results
   The two species differ in their regeneration mode: whereas A. araucana appeared to recruit more continuously in time and space, episodic pulses of establishment were dominant for N. pumilio. At small scales, younger age-class stems of A. araucana were randomly distributed, while older age-class stems were aggregated. This was in contrast to common patterns for temperate tree species, including N. pumilio, following processes of self-thinning. Younger age classes of A. araucana were distributed independently of older trees of both species, but younger age classes of N. pumilio had a negative association with older conspecifics at scales similar to crown diameter.
   Conclusions
   In the absence of recent fires, it is likely that A. araucana would dominate the stand alone, given its greater shade tolerance, greater longevity and continuous recruitment. However, while canopy closure is still incomplete, the shade-intolerant N. pumilio will be able to recruit in those open areas after seed masting and will coexist with A. araucana.

AB Understanding the impacts of environmental changes on species survival is a major challenge in ecological research, especially when shifting from single- to multispecies foci. Here, we apply a spatially explicit two-species simulation model to analyze the effects of geographic range shifting and habitat isolation on different coexistence mechanisms. The model explicitly considers dispersal, local competition, and growth on a single resource. Results highlight that both range shifting and habitat isolation severely impact coexistence. However, the strength of these impacts depends on the underlying coexistence mechanisms. Neutrally coexisting species are particularly sensitive to habitat isolation, while stabilized coexistence through overcompensatory density regulation is much more sensitive to range shifting. We conclude that, at the community level, the response to environmental change sensitively depends on the underlying coexistence mechanisms. This suggests that predictions and management recommendations should consider differences between neutral versus stabilized community structures whenever possible.

ID SEX-RATIO VARIATION; DIOECIOUS PLANTS; FIELD DATA; POPULATIONS; FITNESS
AB Wind-pollinated dioecious plants often exhibit Spatial segregation I of I the sexes. This partial niche separation has most often been explored using abiotic niche axes. However, if the sexes are truly separated in space, then they e apt to encounter different plant species that may heavily affect growth and reproduction. Also, to the extent that their niches differ, the sexes may respond differently to the same co-occurring species. Here we examine interspecific interactions that influence male and female reproductive potential in Atriplex bonnevillensis. Using Emlen's interaction assessment, it technique which assesses species interactions based oil cover classes, we show that Salsola species compete significantly with females but not males, while Halog toll glomeratus competes with males but not females. The effect of competition only became apparent when we corrected for site-specific fertility. These results imply that differential competition must be considered when Studying dioecious plants that display spatial segregation of the sexes.

AB Wildfires are a serious problem affecting many terrestrial ecosystems and causing substantial economic damage. Understanding the variation in structure of fuels (which are predominantly represented by plant litter and live vegetation) is key to understanding the behaviour of wildland fires. An understanding of changes to fuels as vegetation develops is also central to the management of both wildfire and the planning of prescribed burning. A description of fuel structure is required for all models of fire behaviour. It is therefore important that we have an appropriate system for describing fuel structure and predicting how fuel structure will develop through time (i.e. fuel succession). In this paper we review the range of published models used for fuel description and fuel succession. We propose an object-orientated database as an appropriate method for storing the complex data structures that are needed to process and analyse data on fuels. The potential advantages of an object-orientated database as a tool for modelling fuel succession are discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB One of the most conspicuous and widely analyzed patterns in ecology is the latitudinal gradient in species richness. Over the 200 years since its recognition, several hypotheses have accumulated in order to account for spatial variations in diversity. Geographic variations in seasonality have been repeatedly proposed as a determinant of community richness. However, the geographic structure of community seasonality has not yet been analyzed. In the present work we evaluated three hypotheses that account for variations in the temporal structuring of communities: first, environmental seasonality determines community seasonality; second, community richness determines its degree of structuring; and third, the presence of an increase in species segregation with latitude, reflected in a pattern of species negative co-occurrence. The hypotheses were evaluated using path analysis on 29 amphibian communities from South America, connecting latitude, environmental conditions, diversity, seasonality, and coexistence structure - nestedness and negative co-occurrence - within communities. Latitude positively affects community seasonality through an increase in temperature seasonality, but a weak negative direct effect suggests that other variables not considered in the model - such as the strength of biotic interactions - could also be involved. Both latitude and diversity (directly and indirectly) determine an increase in negative co-occurrence and nestedness. This suggests that groups of species that are mutually nested in time are internally segregated. Further, the strength of this structure is determined by community diversity and latitude. Temporal structuring of a community is associated with latitude and diversity, pointing to the existence of a systematic change in community organization far beyond, but probably interrelated, with the recognized latitudinal trend in richness. The available information and analysis supported the three hypotheses evaluated.

AB A comprehensive understanding of species phenological responses to global warming will require observations that are both long-term and spatially extensive. Here we present an analysis of the spring phenological response to climate variation of twelve taxa: six plants, three birds, a frog, and two insects. Phenology was monitored using standardized protocols at 176 meteorological stations in Japan and South Korea from 1953 to 2005, and in some cases even longer. We developed a hierarchical Bayesian model to examine the complex interactions of temperature, site effects, and latitude on phenology. Results show species-specific variation in the magnitude and even in the direction of their responses to increasing temperature, which also differ from site-to-site. At most sites the differences in phenology among species are forecast to become greater with warmer temperatures. Our results challenge the assertion that trends in one geographic region can be extrapolated to others, and emphasize the idiosyncratic nature of the species response to global warming. Field studies are needed to determine how these patterns of variation in species response to climate change affect species interactions and the ability to persist in a changing climate.

AB Aim
   To understand the community structure of mountain ungulates by exploring their niche dynamics in response to sympatric species richness.
   Location
   Ladakh and Spiti Regions of the Western Indian Trans-Himalaya.
   Methods
   We used the blue sheep Pseudois nayaur, a relatively widely distributed mountain ungulate, as a model species to address the issue. We selected three discrete valleys in three protected areas with similar environmental features but varying wild ungulate species richness, and studied blue sheep's diet and habitat utilization in them. Habitat variables such as slope angle, distance to cliff and elevation at blue sheep locations were recorded to determine the habitat width of the species. Faecal pellets were collected and microhistological faecal analysis was carried out to determine the diet width of blue sheep in the three areas with different ungulate species richness. Blue sheep's niche width in terms of habitat and diet was determined using the Shannon's Index.
   Results
   The habitat width of blue sheep had a negative relationship with the number of sympatric species. However, contrary to our expectation, there was a hump-shaped relationship between blue sheep's diet width and the sympatric species richness, with the diet width being narrower in areas of allopatry as well as in areas with high herbivore species richness, and the greatest in areas with moderate species richness.
   Main conclusions
   We suspect that the narrow diet width in allopatry is out of choice, whereas it is out of necessity in areas with high herbivore species richness because of resource partitioning that enables coexistence. We suggest that interactions with sympatric species lead to niche adjustment of mountain ungulates, implying that competition may play a role in structuring Trans-Himalayan mountain ungulate assemblages. Given these results, we underscore the importance of including biotic interactions in species distribution models, which have often been neglected.

AB Previous work on community structure of the invertebrate fauna of Japanese wetlands indicates the presence of intraguild predation between the heteropterans Laccotrephes japonensis (Nepidae) and Kirkaldyia deyrolli (Belostomatidae). We designed a series of experiments to understand the biotic interactions of several species of sympatric heteroptera and their shared prey. Adult Laccotrephes japonensis (Nepidae), first-instar nymph of Kirkaldyia (=Lethocerus) deyrolli (Belostomatidae), Hyla japonica tadpole, and fourth-instar nymph of Appasus japonicus (Belostomatidae) have been shown to be intraguild predator, intraguild prey, common prey, and prey of L. japonensis, respectively. To further understand the factors affecting prey preference by L. japonensis, we also examined the comparison of swimming speed in the three prey animals (K. deyrolli first-instar nymph, A. japonicus fourth-instar nymph, and H. japonica tadpole), and effects of prey animals on weight gain of L. japonensis adult. Despite there being no significant difference in weight gain or swimming speed of the three prey species, L. japonensis exhibited a strong preference for the 1st-instar nymph of K. deyrolli. We suggested that this may be evidence for one of elimination of a potential competitor, K. deyrolli, by L. japonensis through intraguild predation.

AB We used narrowleaf cottonwood, Populus angustifolia, and the gall-forming aphid, Pemphigus betae, to determine the extent to which ontogenetic variation in resistance to herbivory is due to endogenous, stable genetic influences. In a three-year common garden trial using ramets propagated from the top, middle, and bottom of mature trees, we found that the resistance of trees to aphids was significantly higher in top vs. bottom source ramets, supporting the hypothesis of a stable, genetically programmed component to aphid resistance. The magnitude of ontogenetically based variation in resistance within an individual tree is comparable to the genetic variation in resistance among narrowleaf cottonwood genotypes or populations found in other studies. These ontogenetic-based findings have the potential to alter ecological interactions and evolutionary trajectories of plant-herbivore interactions.

AB Specialization in species interactions is of central importance for understanding the ecological structure and evolution of plant-animal mutualisms. Most plant-animal mutualisms are facultative and strongly asymmetric. In particular, myrmecochory (seed dispersal by ants) has been regarded as a very generalized interaction. Although some recent studies have suggested that only a few ant species are really important for dispersal, no rigorous measurement of the specialization in ant-seed dispersal mutualisms has been performed. Here, we use individual plants as basic units for replication to investigate the generalization-specialization of the herb Helleborus foetidus on its ant dispersers over a considerable part of its geographical range. We de. ne generalization in terms of diversity components (species richness and evenness) of the ant visitor that realizes dispersal by removing diaspores. We obtain truly comparable values of ant visitor diversity, distinguishing among different functional groups of visitors and identifying incidental visitors and real ant dispersers. Using null model approaches, we test the null hypothesis that ant-mediated dispersal is a generalized mutualism. At least two premises should be confirmed to validate the hypothesis: (1) diaspores are dispersed by multiple ant-visitor species, and (2) diaspore dispersal is significantly equitable. Though up to 37 ant species visited diaspores across 10 populations, only two large formicines, Camponotus cruentatus and Formica lugubris, were responsible for the vast majority of visits resulting in dispersal in most populations and years, which strongly suggests that ant seed dispersal in H. foetidus is ecologically specialized. Interestingly, specialization degree was unrelated to dispersal success across populations. Our study offers new insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics of myrmecochory. We propose the existence of an alternative scenario to extensive generalization. In this new scenario, generalization is replaced by ecological specialization, which is determined by the intrinsic traits of the plant species rather than by the ecological context in which the interaction takes place.

AB Fundamental gaps remain in our knowledge of how positive species interactions, such as facilitation and mutualism, structure and maintain populations and communities. Foundation species create extensive biogenic habitats, but we know little of how their traits, such as density, age, and patch size, modify their ability to facilitate other species. We tested the role of facilitator traits in cobble beach plant communities in New England, USA. In this system, intertidal beds of the cordgrass Spartina alternifiora facilitate populations of halophytic forbs at higher shore elevations by buffering wave action, stabilizing cobbles, and limiting physical disturbance. Using descriptive and experimental techniques, we tested the hypotheses that (1) the density and height of cordgrass shoots modify the strength of the cordgrass-forb facilitation, and (2) cordgrass peat alone contributes to the facilitation of forbs. Increased shoot density, as well as the combination of cordgrass peat and shoots, positively affected two life history stages (seedling and adult) of the abundant forb Suaeda linearis, demonstrating that cordgrass traits modify the strength of facilitation in this system. Since the expression of traits varies within and among patches of any given foundation species, traits can and should be used to predict the strength of facilitation, to guide the development of conservation strategies, and to develop more accurate models of species interactions.

AB The extent to which community processes can be generalized from local field studies to larger spatial scales remains a contentious issue. The search for broad generality can be hampered when species interactions vary geographically, a common phenomenon attributed to a wide range of underlying ecological factors. Less attention has been directed toward understanding the additional role that evolutionary processes may play in modifying the way that pairs of species interact over large spatial scales. Here we examine whether marked geographic variation in the interaction between a predatory snail (Nucella canaliculata) and an intertidal mussel (Mytilus californianus) arises from phenotypic plasticity or fixed genetic differences among snail populations. Over a three-year period, we reared snails from eight populations in California and Oregon, USA, through two laboratory generations and tested whether family lines differed in their ability to drill M. californianus. Remarkably, F2 generation snails from Oregon sources were generally unable to drill mid-sized Mytilus californianus (5-7 cm long), whereas snails from California readily drilled this prey. Because snails were raised through two generations on a common diet (Mytilus trossulus), these differences among populations likely have a genetic basis. Snails from California and Oregon readily interbred and produced viable offspring in the laboratory, suggesting that populations belong to a single biological species. Field surveys of mussel beds revealed striking geographic variation in predation that closely matched the observed differences in the drilling capacity of N. canaliculata. Drilled M. californianus were common at all sites in California and included many large mussels (>10 cm long). In contrast, drilled M. californianus were rare on the central Oregon coast and consisted mostly of small mussels (< 3 cm). We hypothesize that persistent variation in prey recruitment along the coast has selected for interpopulation differences in the drilling capacity of this direct-developing snail, with potential consequences for the size structure of mussel beds. Combined with growing evidence of restricted gene flow and low connectivity among many marine populations, this study highlights the importance of considering the contribution of evolutionary processes to geographic variation in species interactions.

AB A positive feedback between submerged vegetation and water clarity forms the backbone of the alternative state theory in shallow lakes. The water clearing effect of aquatic vegetation may be caused by different physical, chemical, and biological mechanisms and has been studied mainly in temperate lakes. Recent work suggests differences in biotic interactions between (sub)tropical and cooler lakes might result in a less pronounced clearing effect in the (sub)tropics. To assess whether the effect of submerged vegetation changes with climate, we sampled 83 lakes over a gradient ranging from the tundra to the tropics in South America. Judged from a comparison of water clarity inside and outside vegetation beds, the vegetation appeared to have a similar positive effect on the water clarity across all climatic regions studied. However, the local clearing effect of vegetation decreased steeply with the contribution of humic substances to the underwater light attenuation. Looking at turbidity on a whole-lake scale, results were more difficult to interpret. Although lakes with abundant vegetation (> 30%) were generally clear, sparsely vegetated lakes differed widely in clarity. Overall, the effect of vegetation on water clarity in our lakes appears to be smaller than that found in various Northern hemisphere studies. This might be explained by differences in fish communities and their relation to vegetation. For instance, unlike in Northern hemisphere studies, we find no clear relation between vegetation coverage and fish abundance or their diet preference. High densities of omnivorous fish and coinciding low grazing pressures on phytoplankton in the (sub)tropics may, furthermore, weaken the effect of vegetation on water clarity.

AB The effects of experimental nitrogen (N) additions (0, 12.5, and 50 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)) on long-term (12 years) understorey vegetation dynamics were examined in a boreal forest. The results showed that two types of natural enemies of the dominant dwarf-shrub Vaccinium myrtillus (pathogenic fungus of the species Valdensia heterodoxa and herbivorous larvae of the genus Operophtera) influenced the vegetation dynamics. The pathogenic fungus, causing premature leaf-shed of V. myrtillus, showed a strong positive N response during the initial 5-year period. For the larvae, a relatively modest N response was overshadowed by an almost 40-fold population increase during an outbreak event that followed the initial 5-year period. This outbreak occurred irrespective of N addition, resulting in V. myrtillus decline and depriving the pathogenic fungus of its substrate. Hence our study demonstrates that vegetation dynamics in this relatively species poor and seemingly simple ecosystem are driven by complex biotic interactions. Further, we show that an important component of these interactions is the temporal alternation of the two natural enemies and, resultant regulation of the dominant plant's abundance. Finally, we emphasize that long-term data are essential to capture the complexity of this type of biotic interactions. In our case, a short-term study may have resulted in markedly different conclusions regarding effects of N enrichment and the role of biotic interactions for forest vegetation dynamics.

AB P>1. Leaves that fall into the water represent a new habitat for microorganisms to colonise in streams, providing an opportunity to study colonisation and the subsequent regulation of community structure. We explored community composition of bacteria and fungi on decomposing alder leaves in nine streams in central Sweden, and describe their relationship with environmental variables. Succession of the microbial community was studied in one of the streams for 118 days. Microbial community composition was examined by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis on replicate samples of leaves from each stream.
   2. During succession in one stream, maximum taxon richness was reached after 34 days for bacteria and 20 days for fungi respectively. Replicate samples within this stream differed between each other earlier in colonisation, while subsequently such variation among replicate communities was low and remained stable for several weeks. Replicate samples taken from all the nine streams after 34 days of succession showed striking similarities in microbial communities within-streams, although communities differed more strongly between streams.
   3. Canonical analysis of microbial communities and environmental variables revealed that water chemistry had a significant influence on community composition. This influence was superimposed on a statistical relationship between the properties of stream catchments and microbial community composition.
   4. The catchment regulates microbial communities in two different ways. It harbours the species pool from which the in-stream microbial community is drawn and it governs stream chemistry and the composition of organic substrates that further shape the communities. We suggest that there is a random element to colonisation early in succession, whereas other factors such as species interactions, stream chemistry and organic substrate properties, result in a more deterministic regulation of communities during later stages.

AB P>1. New insights into the mechanisms and outcomes of facilitation have led to important advances in our understanding of ecological patterns and processes. However, the effects of facilitation on non-successional community dynamics have yet to be developed into a general theory.
   2. By synthesizing spatial and temporal relationships between biotic interactions and environmental severity, a new model of facilitation-driven community dynamics is presented that applies to any facilitative mechanism related to abiotic stress or resource limitation.
   3. In general, facilitation tends to stabilize community dynamics in moderately severe environments, due to a buffering effect of increased facilitation during more severe periods and enhanced competitive effects in milder conditions. In contrast, a strong negative relationship between environmental severity and facilitative strength in highly severe environments leads to a destabilizing effect of facilitation on community dynamics.
   4. If only mature plants have significant facilitative effects, developmental lags may be introduced that decouple environmental fluctuations and community dynamics, decreasing the effects of facilitation on community stability. Additionally, dual regulation of facilitation by environmental and demographic factors decouples abundance from climate and produces periodic local extinctions. In general, the interplay of facilitation and competition produce highly variable dynamics in moderate-severity environments, whereas qualitatively similar results were found in high-severity environments regardless of facilitative mechanism or model parameters.
   5. Additional variation in community dynamics can be explained by the combination of effect and response functional traits of species within a community. The relative abundance and proportion of species within a community falling into one of four different effect and response categories provide an effective framework for predicting responses to climatic variation and biotic interactions.
   6.Synthesis. Facilitation either increases or decreases community stability in predictable ways as a function of empirically identifiable environmental gradients. Effects of developmental lags, complex controls of facilitative mechanisms and species' functional traits explain additional variation in community dynamics that can be applied to a broad array of ecosystems in which facilitation occurs.

AB P> The stress gradient hypothesis (SGH) predicts a shift from net negative interactions in benign environments towards net positive in harsh environments in ecological communities. While several studies found support for the SGH, others found evidence against it, leading to a debate on how nature and strength of species interactions change along stress gradients, and to calls for new empirical and theoretical work.
   In the latest attempt in this journal, it is successfully argued how the SGH should be expanded by considering different life strategies of species (stress tolerance versus competitive ability) and characteristics of abiotic stress (resource versus non-resource based) over wider stress gradients (opposed to low-high contrasts), but the crucial role of biotic stress by consumers is largely ignored in this refinement.
   We point out that consumers strongly alter the outcome of species interactions in benign and harsh environments, and show how inclusion of consumer-incurred biotic stress alters the predicted outcome of interactions along resource- and non-resource-based stress gradients for stress-tolerant and competitive benefactors and beneficiaries.
   Synthesis. New studies should include stress gradients consisting of both abiotic and biotic components to disentangle their impacts, and to improve our understanding of how species interactions change along environmental gradients.

AB Ecological interactions are an important source of rapid evolutionary change and thus may generate a significant portion of novel biodiversity. Such changes may be particularly prevalent in parasites, where hosts can induce strong selection for adaptation. To understand the relative frequency at which host-associated divergences occur, it is essential to examine the evolutionary history of the divergence process, particularly when it is occurring over large geographical scales where both geographical and host-associated isolation may playa part. In this study, we use population genetics and phylogeography to study the evolutionary history of host-associated divergence in the seabird tick Ixodes uriae (Acari, Ixodidae). We compare results from microsatellite markers that reflect more ecological timescales with a conserved mitochondrial gene (COIII) that reflects more ancient divergence events. Population structure based on microsatellites showed clear evidence of host-associated divergence in all colonies examined. However, isolated populations of the same host type did not always group together in overall analyses and the genetic differentiation among sympatric host races was highly variable. In contrast, little host or geographical structure was found for the mitochondrial gene fragment. These results suggest that host race formation in I. uriae is a recent phenomenon, that it may have occurred several times and that local interactions are at different points in the divergence process. Rapid divergence in I. uriae implies a strong interaction with its local host species, an interaction that will alter the ecological dynamics of the system and modify the epidemiological landscape of circulating micropathogens.

AB Species interactions such as predation or competition can have notable implications for fish population dynamics. Stock status and associated biological reference points can be misrepresented if these interactions are not considered. Here we present a multispecies, biomass production model (MS-PROD) developed by incorporating modifications to the Schaefer production model. The modifications explicitly emphasize a functional group approach, highlighting the effects of species interactions that include competition between species within a group, competition between groups, and predation. The mathematical formulation also includes constraints on carrying capacity for both the entire system and for individual groups. We applied the model as initialized to the Northeast U.S. Large Marine Ecosystem finfish community. We then executed simulations designed to explore the behavior of the model with respect to fishery exploitation and ecological interactions. Collectively, the results demonstrated the utility, and the need, for incorporating ecological effects into fisheries models. (C) Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Not all species are likely to be equally affected by habitat fragmentation; thus, we evaluated the effects of size of forest remnants on trophically linked communities of plants, leaf-mining insects, and their parasitoids. We explored the possibility of differential vulnerability to habitat area reduction in relation to species-specific and food-web traits by comparing species-area regression slopes. Moreover, we searched for a synergistic effect of these traits and of trophic level. We collected mined leaves and recorded plant, leaf miner, and parasitoid species interactions in five 100-m(2) transects in 19 Chaco Serrano woodland remnants in central Argentina. Species were classified into extreme categories according to body size, natural abundance, trophic breadth, and trophic level. Species-area slopes differed between groups with extreme values of natural abundance or trophic specialization. Nevertheless, synergistic effects of life-history and food-web traits were only found for trophic level and trophic breadth: area-related species loss was highest for specialist parasitoids. It has been suggested that species position within interaction webs could determine their vulnerability to extinction. Our results provide evidence that food-web parameters, such as trophic level and trophic breadth, affect species sensitivity to habitat fragmentation.

AB The effect of artificial habitat in altered landscapes on species interactions and their suite of enemies is largely unknown. Water mites have been associated with reduced fitness of model damselflies. Mite parasitism was variable, but higher for Ischnura verticalis damselflies from natural, than from artificial, wetlands in the same region. There were no differences in timing of sampling, temperature during sampling, or host age or sex composition of samples between wetland types. Landscape structure might constrain mite presence or abundance at wetland sites or wetland type might be a better predictor of mites, based on factors such as prey abundance. Fewer mites on damselflies from numerous artificial wetlands means that the strength of parasite-mediated selection is likely less than would be inferred if only natural wetlands were surveyed. Such effects of human changes in habitats on host species probably occur often.

AB Predators are often the most vulnerable group to extinction, yet the consequences of changing predator diversity are poorly understood. One source of confusion has been different experimental designs. The multiple-predator effects literature typically employs an additive design, while the biodiversity ecosystem function literature typically uses a replacement design. Separately, these designs each detect only a subset of the changes in food web interactions caused by predator loss. Here, we measure the impact of consumer diversity on sessile marine invertebrates using a combination additive-replacement design. We couple this with a meta-analysis of previous combination experiments. We use these two approaches to explore how each design can detect different types of interactions among predators. We find that, while high diversity does lead to more negative interspecific interactions, the strength of these interactions is often weaker than negative intraspecific interactions caused by increasing the density of a single species alone. We conclude that a hybrid design is the optimal method to explore the mechanisms behind the effects of changing predator diversity. If researchers merely want to know the consequences of changing predator diversity, at a bare minimum, the experimental design must mimic the actual changes in both predator density and diversity in their system of interest. However, only a hybrid design can distinguish the consequences of shifting the balance of interspecific and intraspecific interactions within a community, an issue of great importance when considering both natural diversity loss and pest biocontrol.

AB A component of metabolic scaling theory has worked towards understanding the influence of metabolism over the generation and maintenance of biodiversity. Specific models within this 'metabolic theory of biodiversity' (MTB) have addressed temperature gradients in speciation rate and species richness, but the scope of MTB has been questioned because of empirical departures from model predictions. In this study, we first show that a generalized MTB is not inconsistent with empirical patterns and subsequently implement an eco-evolutionary MTB which has thus far only been discussed qualitatively. More specifically, we combine a functional trait (body mass) approach and an environmental gradient (temperature) with a dynamic eco-evolutionary model that builds on the current MTB. Our approach uniquely accounts for feedbacks between ecological interactions (size-dependent competition and predation) and evolutionary rates (speciation and extinction). We investigate a simple example in which temperature influences mutation rate, and show that this single effect leads to dynamic temperature gradients in macroevolutionary rates and community structure. Early in community evolution, temperature strongly influences speciation and both speciation and extinction strongly influence species richness. Through time, niche structure evolves, speciation and extinction rates fall, and species richness becomes increasingly independent of temperature. However, significant temperature-richness gradients may persist within emergent functional (trophic) groups, especially when niche breadths are wide. Thus, there is a strong signal of both history and ecological interactions on patterns of species richness across temperature gradients. More generally, the successful implementation of an eco-evolutionary MTB opens the perspective that a process-based MTB can continue to emerge through further development of metabolic models that are explicit in terms of functional traits and environmental gradients.

AB P>1. Ecological interactions that involve aggressive confrontations between animals are important in shaping the evolution of morphology, behaviour and life history. However, as such confrontations are rarely witnessed, direct quantification of the intensity of these processes in natural populations is notoriously difficult. While the utilization of the frequency of non-lethal injuries is fraught with difficulties, it may provide information concerning different types of interaction, such as predation, intraspecific aggression and interspecific interference competition.
   2. In this paper, we report on an exceptionally large difference in toe loss incidence between two populations of Podarcis sicula lizards living on small, neighbouring islands in the Adriatic Sea. We caught 900 lizards and recorded the number and location of missing toes. Subsequently, we investigated five non-mutually exclusive hypotheses concerning differences in bite force capacity, bone strength, predation intensity, average age and intraspecific aggression that may provide proximate explanations for the observed differences in injury frequencies.
   3. Bite force differences differed considerably between the populations, but bone strength was found to be stronger in the populations with a higher frequency of natural scars. Predation pressure clearly differed between the populations, but we found higher injury rates under predation relaxation.
   4. Our results indicate that density and consequently an increased intraspecific competition is the most likely explanation for the observed high frequencies of injuries. We suggest that the intensity of toe amputation between lizard populations may be a useable indirect indication for the intensity of intraspecific competition.
   5. This study shows how a combination of morphological, physiological, behavioural and ecological measurements can be used to test assumptions implicit to alternative explanations of an observed phenomenon. Such tests can reveal how likely each of these explanations is, even if the processes leading to the phenomenon are difficult to observe directly.

AB 1. Insect pests in agricultural systems are one of the major causes of damage to crop production and storage worldwide. However, the study of the effect of multiple pests on agricultural productivity has remained largely disconnected from the ongoing debate on how species diversity affects the productivity of ecosystems. The aim of our study is to use information from crop studies to inform the debate on species diversity and ecosystem productivity.
   2. We present the results of an experimental study that manipulated the species richness of three tuber feeding moth species (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) at constant larval density. We measured the influence of this manipulation on (1) damage to the economically most important crop in the Andean region, the potato Solanum tuberosum and (2) the performance of the moths as a consequence of feeding rates.
   3. Our results showed that the three pest species together cause more damage to the crop than is predicted from the effects of each pest alone. This resulted in significant increases in pupal biomass and fecundity.
   4. Potential mechanisms to explain our results are (1) more complete resource utilization and thus greater crop damage (feeding complementarity) and (2) negative interactions, where intra-specific interactions are greater than inter-specific interactions.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Our findings may have important consequences for integrated pest management in poor tropical countries. Biodiversity in many tropical countries is decreasing rapidly, leading to reductions in ecosystem services such as biocontrol and pollination. At the same time an increasing number of species, many of them agricultural pests, are being introduced by humans. Our results show that the potential complementarity effects among pest species may increase damage to field crops to a larger extent than previously expected. Control strategies to limit the introduction of new pest species are therefore urgently needed in these countries where the daily management of biological resources is largely in the hands of poor rural people and local government staff with limited funding.

AB Question: How does the intensity of species interactions affect species and functional group composition of an annual plant community?
   Location: Sede Boqer, Negev Desert, Israel.
   Methods: The potential for competitive interactions in two annual plant communities (desert and coastal) from semi-stabilized sand dunes was manipulated by varying seed bank density and therefore the number of potentially interacting individuals. Communities were exposed to three different irrigation regimes, mimicking precipitation at the desert site, the coastal site, and an intermediate precipitation level. Plots were maintained for 3 years, and percentage cover of each species in the plots was recorded at the end of each growing season. We used redundancy analysis to test for effects of initial density, irrigation, and year on the species and functional group composition of the communities.
   Results: Initial density had significant effects on species composition, and these effects remained significant over 3 years, even as total community percentage cover became more similar among treatments over time. Density effects did not depend on resource availability (irrigation level). Functional group identity or individual plant size did not predict which species would be good competitors, and a species' competitive ability did not predict its abundance in the field.
   Conclusions: Species interactions strongly affect community composition, and those effects carry over into subsequent years such that competition does not lead to convergence in community structure over time. However, the particular changes in composition observed were not predictable by some of the traits that have been found important in individual-level experiments. We speculate that the outcome of competition in diverse communities will depend on multiple traits, in contrast to the outcome of individual-level pairwise experiments. We also speculate that the shift in composition with density could mean that local variation in density may contribute to maintenance of diversity in this system.

AB Many factors can affect the assembly of communities, ranging from species pools to habitat effects to interspecific interactions. In microbial communities, the predominant focus has been on the well-touted ability of microbes to disperse and the environment acting as a selective filter to determine which species are present. In this study, we investigated the role of biotic interactions (e.g., competition, facilitation) in fungal endophyte community assembly by examining endophyte species co-occurrences within communities using null models. We used recombinant inbred lines (genotypes) of maize (Zea mays) to examine community assembly at multiple habitat levels, at the individual plant and host genotype levels. Both culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches were used to assess endophyte communities. Communities were analyzed using the complete fungal operational taxonomic unit (OTU) dataset or only the dominant (most abundant) OTUs in order to ascertain whether species co-occurrences were different for dominant members compared to when all members were included. In the culture-dependent approach, we found that for both datasets, OTUs co-occurred on maize genotypes more frequently than expected under the null model of random species co-occurrences. In the culture-independent approach, we found that OTUs negatively co-occurred at the individual plant level but were not significantly different from random at the genotype level for either the dominant or complete datasets. Our results showed that interspecific interactions can affect endophyte community assembly, but the effects can be complex and depend on host habitat level. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine endophyte community assembly in the same host species at multiple habitat levels. Understanding the processes and mechanisms that shape microbial communities will provide important insights into microbial community structure and the maintenance of microbial biodiversity.

AB Competition between microorganisms and arthropods has been shown to be an important ecological interaction determining animal development and spatial distribution patterns in saprophagous communities. In fruit-inhabiting Drosophila, variation in insect developmental success is not only determined by species-specific effects of various noxious filamentous fungi but, as suggested by an earlier study, also by additive genetic variation in the ability to successfully withstand the negative impact of the fungi. If this variation represents a direct adaptive response to the degree to which insect breeding substrates are infested with harmful fungi, genetic variation for successful development in the presence of fungi could be maintained by variation in infestation of resource patches with fungi. We selected for the ability to resist the negative influence of mould by maintaining replicated Drosophila melanogaster populations on substrates infested with Aspergillus nidulans. After five cycles of exposure to the fungus during the larval stage, the selected populations were compared with unselected control populations regarding adult survival and reproduction to reveal an evolved resistance against the fungal competitor. On fungus-infested larval feeding substrates, emerged adults from mould-selected populations had higher survival rates and higher early fecundity than the control populations. In the unselected populations, females had higher mortality rates than males, and a high proportion of both females and males appeared to be unable to lay eggs or fertilise eggs, respectively. When larvae developed on non-infested food we found indications of a loss of resistance to abiotic and starvation stress in the adult stage in flies from the selected populations. This suggests that there are costs associated with an increase in resistance against the microbial competitor. We discuss the underlying mechanisms that might have selected for increased resistance against harmful fungi.

AB Ecological interactions between different species are not fixed, but they may depend, at least to some extent, on the particular genotypes involved as well as on the environmental conditions experienced by previous generations. We used a set of natural genotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana, that previously experienced contrasting nutrient and herbivory conditions, to test for the influences of genetic variation and maternal effects on competitive interactions between Arabidopsis and the weedy annuals Anagallis arvensis and Senecio vulgaris. We used activated carbon to discriminate between resource competition and allelopathy components of plant-plant interactions. There was a clear competitive hierarchy: Senecio > Arabidopsis > Anagallis. Although we found no evidence for allelopathic potential of Arabidopsis, our results indicate that both Anagallis and Senecio exerted negative (direct or indirect) allelopathic effects on Arabidopsis. There were significant differences among Arabidopsis genotypes in their competitive effects on both neighbor species, as well as in their response to competition. Maternal environments significantly influenced not only the growth and fitness of Arabidopsis itself, but also its competitive effect on Anagallis. We found, however, no evidence that maternal environments affected the competitive effect on Senecio or overall competitive response of Arabidopsis. Generally, resource competition played a greater role than allelopathy, and genotype effects were more important than maternal effects. Our study demonstrates that ecological interactions, such as plant competition, are complex and multi-layered, and that, in particular, the influence of genetic variation on interactions with other species should not be overlooked.

AB Tests for species interactions that involve the comparison of a statistic calculated from observed matrix of species presences and absences with the distribution of the same statistic generated from a null model have been used by ecologists for about 30 years. We argue that the validity of these tests requires a specific definition of independence. In particular, we note that an assumption that is often made is that all presence-absence matrices with the same row and column totals are equally likely if there is no interaction. However, we show using a simple model for species presences and absences without any species interactions that, in general, this assumption should be made with caution. Our model incorporates a definition of independence, allowing the computation of probabilities of different patterns in the null matrices. Other definitions of independence are possible; one of them is outlined using a new generalized linear model approach for carrying out tests applicable to different null models with or without the assumption of keeping row and column totals fixed.

AB The dynamics of species interactions are of central importance for the understanding of ecological coexistence, community structure and the effects of biological invasions. Using bark beetles that colonize the same habitat as an example, we explore species interactions in a resource-based model system with positive feedback between insect abundance and resource availability. The net interspecies interaction was found to be highly dynamic and may alternate in time between competition and mutualism. When both bark beetle species were able to kill trees ("aggressive"), our simulations showed strong facilitations between beetle species. This may lead to escape from control by competition, and increase the frequency of outbreaks of tree-killing. The frequency of net positive interactions varied with interaction strengths and the relative aggressiveness of the species and was highest when both species were strongly aggressive; which predicts disastrous outbreaks if, e.g., the European spruce bark beetle Ips typographus and the North American spruce beetle Dendroctonus rufipennis should become interacting species due to introductions. In imbalanced pairs, the relatively less aggressive species was facilitated more often than the aggressive species. Net positive interactions did not occur for strongly inferior species, but their survival was an increasing function of interaction strength with aggressive species and availability of resources. The benefits for the inferior species in the model are consistent with the structure of one aggressive and several less aggressive or non-aggressive species, which is common in bark beetle communities in many parts of the world.

AB An effective measure to cope with eutrophication of lakes is to remove nutrients that can cause algal blooming by taking advantage of natural water purification processes. Here the term "purification" is defined, in a wide sense, as the potential role of a water body to contribute to the reduction of pollutants and thus controlling eutrophication. Also regarded as a kind of ecological regulating services, biological purification involves various processes concerning seasonal nutrient fixation, such as uptake by aquatic macrophytes, biofouling onto foliage substrates. feeding by organisms in higher trophic level, and eternal loss or removal of substance from the water. In order to evaluate the water purification ability, a numerical lake ecosystem model highlighting the role of macrophyte colonies in the shore zone was developed and applied to Lakes Suwa, Kasumi and Biwa, as well as five small lakes attached to Lake Biwa.
   The model includes the biological interactions between pelagic compartments (phyto- and zooplankton, detritus, dissolved organic matter, pelagic fish and nutrients) and benthic compartments (macrophytes, epiphytic algae, phytal animals, macro- and megalobenthos, and demersal fish). Under dynamic forcing of meteorological and hydrological parameters, the model was run over a year to evaluate the annual nutrient cycles and purification functions. The reproducibility of the model was validated for each water body by comparison with the field data from the water quality monitoring campaign. Numerical results revealed that the water purification ability, from viewpoints of both stock and flux, generally tends to be higher in the shore region than in the offshore region owing to a wide variety of aquatic biota. Moreover, it increases almost in proportion to the density of vegetation in the shore region. Nutrient fluxes representing the purification processes turned out to be closely connected with the surface area or equivalently with the retention time of the water bodies, suggesting that biological purification does not become dominant against physical turnover until the surface area reaches around 10(3) ha or the retention time exceeds the order of 10(2) days.

AB To assess habitat suitability (HS) has become an increasingly important component of species/ecosystem management. HS assessment is usually based on presence/absence data related to environmental variables. An exception is Ecological Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA), which uses only presence data and which does not require absence data. Most HS modelling is based on input of all environmental parameters (EnvPs) without environmental categorization, and does not take into account species interaction and human intervention for an assessment of HS. In this study, the EnvPs are arranged into four features: geographical features, consumable features, human-factor features, and species-human interaction features. These features affect species with respect to movement, behavior and activity. The research presented here has used an already existing dataset of wildlife species and human activities/visitations, which was compiled during 2004-2006 in Phu-Khieo Wildlife Sanctuary (PKWS). Data from 2004 to 2005 were used to produce HS maps, while the data of 2006 were used for evaluating these maps. Sambar Deer (SD) was chosen to predict its own HS. Six HS maps of SD were analyzed using ENFA in the following manner: (1) inputting all EnvPs together, (2) inputting each feature, separately and (3) integrating the four resulting HS maps by model averaging. It was found that model averaging was capable of predicting the HS of SD more reliably than the model with all EnvPs put in together. Multiple linear regressions were computed between the HS map with all EnvPs and the HS maps with each feature. The results show that the HS map with only geographical features has the highest coefficient value (0.516) while the coefficient values of other HS maps with the above features are 0.296, 0.53 and -0.006, respectively. This indicates that the geographical features have an influence on the other features and that the predicting power is lower when all EnvPs are computed in the ENFA model. Therefore, in order to generate HS, each feature should at first be put into the model separately. Following that, the average of all features will be combined. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB Understanding how climate change affects the structure and function of communities is critical for gauging its full impact on biodiversity. To date, community-level changes have been poorly documented, owing, in part, to the paucity of long-term datasets. To circumvent this, the use of 'space-for-time' substitution-the forecasting of temporal trends from spatial climatic gradients-has increasingly been adopted, often with little empirical support. Here we examine changes from 1975 to 2001 in three community attributes (species richness, body mass and occupancy) for 404 assemblages of terrestrial winter avifauna in North America containing a total of 227 species. We examine the accuracy of space-for-time substitution and assess causal associations between community attributes and observed changes in annual temperature using a longitudinal study design. Annual temperature and all three community attributes increased over time. The trends for the three community attributes differed significantly from the spatially derived predictions, although richness showed broad congruence. Correlations with trends in temperature were found with richness and body mass. In the face of rapid climate change, applying space-for-time substitution as a predictive tool could be problematic with communities developing patterns not reflected by spatial ecological associations.

AB The relative importance of local and regional processes in shaping natural communities within a metacommunity context has been a focus of intense debate in recent years. Floodplain lakes provide a good system for testing this theoretical approach, as they undergo seasonal variations in physical, chemical and biological factors, as well as in their degree of connectivity. Here. we investigated how local phytoplankton communities in lakes of a tropical river-floodplain system (Araguaia River floodplain - Central Brazil) were affected by environmental and spatial (dispersal) predictors in two rainy and two dry seasons (two consecutive years). Partial redundancy analysis indicated that during the periods analyzed the effects of neither predictor were significant. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that these tropical phytoplankton communities could be regulated by stochastic events, we suggested that further studies will have greater explanatory power if they include other variables related to biotic interactions (e.g., abundance of grazers) and fine-scale environmental variation.

AB Accumulation of phytoecdysteroids in agricultural populations of R. carthamoides (Willd.) Iljin and S. coronata L. and their resistance to insect herbivores in different ontogenetic periods were investigated for 16 years. As a result of the investigations, species-specific features of ecdysteroid accumulation in vegetative and reproductive plant organs were determined; relationships between the distribution of phytoecdysteroids in the structure of plants and ecological interactions with insects have been revealed; the factors contributing to insect infestation have been studied; and the pest damage has been evaluated.

AB In nature, prey and predator species are embedded in complex networks of ecological interactions. As a consequence, organism level reactions such as predator-induced prey defenses will not only influence the dynamics of both the prey exhibiting the response and its inducer predator, but also that of a wider set of populations that interact directly or indirectly with them.
   In this work our aim is to determine the consequences of community-level side effects, defense specificity, and timing of inducible defenses for the stability of model ecological communities. We shall consider small webs of two and three trophic levels, containing one to three species per level. The model food webs include well-known community motifs that will be studied by means of qualitative analyses of the community matrix. Our results show that side effects that suppress non-focal interactions were able to decrease community stability, particularly when defensive responses were delayed. Conversely, side effects that increase the strength of non-focal interactions stabilized communities. This work also shows that as the defensive response became more specific, it is more likely to obtain a stable community. In general terms, our results revealed that delayed responses decrease the likelihood of system stability. Our results highlight the importance of the underlying biology of species interactions for the definition of the proper topology, and consequently dynamics, of complex ecological networks.

AB Climate change is expected to alter trophic interactions within food chains, but predicting the fate of particular species is difficult because the predictions hinge on knowing exactly how climate influences direct and indirect interactions. We used two complementary approaches to examine how climate change may alter trophic interactions within an old-field food web composed of herbaceous plants, grasshopper herbivores, and spider predators. We synthesized data spanning 15 years of experimentation during which interannual mean growing season temperature varied by 2 degrees C and precipitation by 2.5 cm. We also manipulated temperature within mesocosms to test the affect of temperature on primary production and strength of direct and indirect trophic interactions. Both approaches produced similar results: plant production was not directly affected by temperature or precipitation, but the strength of top-down indirect effects on grasses and forbs increased by 30-40% per 1 degrees C. Hence, the net effect of climate change was to strengthen top-down control of this terrestrial system.

AB Context dependency, variation in the outcome of species interactions with biotic and abiotic conditions, is increasingly considered ubiquitous among mutualisms. Despite several qualitative reviews of many individual empirical studies, there has been little quantitative synthesis examining the generality of context dependency, or conditions that may promote it. We conducted a meta-analysis of ant-plant protection mutualisms to examine the generality of context-dependent effects of ants on herbivory and plant performance (growth, reproduction). Our results show that ant effects on plants are not generally context dependent, but instead are routinely positive and rarely neutral, as overall effect sizes of ants in reducing herbivory and increasing plant performance were positive and significantly greater than 0. The magnitude of these positive effects did vary, however. Variation in plant performance was not explained by the type of biotic or abiotic factor examined, including plant rewards (extra. oral nectar, food bodies, domatia), ant species richness, plant growth form, or latitude. With the exception of plant growth form, these factors did contribute to the effects of ants in reducing herbivory. Reductions in herbivory were greater for plants with than without domatia, and greatest for plants with both domatia and food bodies. Effect sizes of ants in reducing herbivory decreased, but remained positive, with latitude and ant species richness. Effect sizes in reducing herbivory were greater in tropical vs. temperate systems. Although ant-plant interactions have been pivotal in the study of context dependency of mutualisms, our results, along with other recent meta-analyses, indicate that context dependency may not be a general feature of mutualistic interactions. Rather, ant-plant protection mutualisms appear to be routinely positive for plants, and only occasionally neutral.

AB Geographic variation in species interactions can have major effects on distributions. Effects of such variation can be particularly evident for invasive species, in which variation in competitive ability can influence invasive success and impacts. We tested the hypothesis that coexistence or exclusion of the resident mosquito Aedes aegypti results from variation among local populations of the invasive Aedes albopictus in competitive interactions with A. aegypti. We also examined the role of variation in fecundity-size relationships in these competitive interactions. We compared competitive abilities of nine North American populations of A. albopictus, three populations from each of three site types: extinction of A. aegypti following A. albopictus invasion, coexistence following A. albopictus invasion, and A. albopictus allopatric to A. aegypti. Competition among larvae from each A. albopictus population and a single A. aegypti population was tested in laboratory microcosms in a response surface design. We found interpopulation differences in competitive ability of A. albopictus, but no strong patterns among site types. Extinction sites had steeper average fecundity-size relationships than coexistence sites and allopatric sites, but this did not translate into superior population performance. Certain individual A. albopictus populations had exceptionally large competitive effects on A. aegypti or poor competitive responses to competition from A. aegypti, but competitive effect and response were not correlated. These results suggest that interpopulation variation in the competitive ability of A. albopictus may only partly explain the geographic pattern of coexistence with or extinction of A. aegypti. Environmental differences among regions may affect the competitive ability of A. albopictus and influence its invasion success and impact.

AB The prediction of the effects of disturbances in natural systems is limited by the general lack of knowledge on the strength of species interactions, i.e., the effect of one species on the population growth rate of another, and by the uncertainty of the effects that may be manifested via indirect pathways within the food web. Here we explored the consequences of changes in species populations for the remaining species within nine exceptionally well-characterized empirical food webs, for which, unlike the vast majority of other published webs, feeding links have been fully quantied. Using the inverse of the Jacobian matrix, we found that perturbations to species with few connections have larger net effects (considering both direct and indirect pathways between two species) on the rest of the food web than do disturbances to species that are highly connected. For 40% of predator-prey links, predators had positive net effects on prey populations, due to the predominance of indirect interactions. Our results highlight the fundamental, but often counterintuitive, role of indirect effects for the maintenance of food web complexity and biodiversity.

AB The ability to forecast community dynamics requires, among other things, an understanding of indirect effects and nonlinearities in webs of interacting species, together with knowledge of how habitat structure mediates interactions. We explored these aspects for a coral reef system in Moorea, French Polynesia, involving intraguild predation where the shared damselfish prey (juvenile yellowtail dascyllus Dascyllus flavicaudus) and two species of intraguild (IG) prey (the ambush predators arc-eye hawkfish Paracirrhites arcatus and red-spotted coral crab Trapezia rufopunctata) shelter together in branching Pocilloporid corals for protection from mobile IG predators. Field experiments revealed that both IG prey had strong adverse effects on survivorship of juvenile damselfish, but that the dominant underlying process was competition for enemy-free space and not direct consumption. In this case, the combined effect of hawkfish and crabs did not result in either risk enhancement or risk reduction for the damselfish. Similarly, the combined influence of IG predators and IG prey on the shared prey also was indistinguishable from that expected from their independent effects. Habitat structure weakened the IG-prey-IG-predator interaction; IG prey were much stronger space competitors with damselfish than resource competitors with IG predators. As a consequence, there was not a trophic cascade where damselfish benefited by the adverse effect of IG predators on hawkfish or coral crabs. These results highlight the manner by which habitat structure can mediate species interactions and emphasize the need to understand the underlying mechanisms.

AB P>1. Crayfish are among the most threatened taxa in the world and invasive crayfish are the primary cause of the decline of native crayfish. Most research has emphasised biotic interactions as the mechanism by which native crayfish are displaced by invasives, although crayfish occupy variable environments and the role of disturbance in facilitating crayfish invasion and displacement is understudied.
   2. We compared tolerance to a disturbance, stream drying, in a native and invasive crayfish as a potential mechanism to explain their distribution. Our experiments and observations were conducted across scales, from laboratory environmental chambers to stream mesocosms to field sampling. We hypothesised that the invasive crayfish would be more tolerant of desiccation than the native, and that this physiological distinction between the two would be reflected in their distribution in relation to stream drying.
   3. In the laboratory, the native crayfish Orconectes eupunctus was less tolerant of desiccation than the invasive Orconectes neglectus chaenodactylus, with all native crayfish dying within 2 days without water, while some of the invasive crayfish survived for nearly 2 weeks. Under simulated stream drying in mesocosms, only the native O. eupunctus survived less well than in a control. Field sampling demonstrated a significant negative relationship between O. eupunctus density and low summer flows, while O. neglectus density was positively associated with low summer flows. The greater resistance of O. neglectus to drying could, through priority effects, inhibit recolonisation by O. eupunctus once flow resumes.
   4. Abiotic disturbances are potentially important to the displacement of native by invasive crayfish. Disturbance mediated displacement of aquatic species provides both an opportunity to conserve native species by maintaining or restoring habitat and disturbance regimes and is also a challenge due to increasing human water demand, flow regime alteration and global climate change.

AB P>1. Reproductive interference is a negative interspecific sexual interaction that adversely affects the fitness of males and females during reproductive process. Theoretical studies suggest that because reproductive interference is characterized by positive frequency dependence it is far more likely to cause species exclusion than the density dependence of resource competition. However, the respective contributions of resource competition and reproductive interference to species exclusion, which have been frequently observed in many competition studies, remain unclear.
   We show that reproductive interference is a far more critical cause of species exclusion than resource competition in the competition between Callosobruchus bean weevil species. In competition experiments over several generations, we manipulated the initial relative abundance of the adzuki bean beetle, Callosobruchus chinensis, and the southern cowpea beetle, Callosobruchus maculatus. When the initial adult ratio of C. chinensis : C. maculatus were 6 : 2 and 4 : 4, C. chinensis excluded C. maculatus. However, when C. maculatus was four times more abundant than C. chinensis at the start, we observed the opposite outcome.
   A behavioural experiment using adults of the two species revealed asymmetric reproductive interference. The fecundity and longevity of C. maculatus females, but not those of C. chinensis females, decreased when the females were kept with heterospecific males. Fecundities of females of both species decreased as the number of heterospecific males increased. In contrast, resource competition at the larval stage resulted in higher survival of C. maculatus than of C. chinensis.
   These results suggest that the positive frequency-dependent effect of reproductive interference resulted in species exclusion, depending on the initial population ratio of the two species, and the asymmetry of the interference resulted in C. chinensis being dominant in this study, as in previous studies. Classical competition studies should be reviewed in light of this evidence for reproductive interference.

AB Aim
   To determine the relationship between the species richness of woody plants and that of mammals after accounting for the effect of environmental variables.
   Location
   Southern Africa, including Namibia, South Africa, Lesotho, Swaziland, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and part of Mozambique.
   Methods
   We used a comprehensive dataset including the species richness of mammals and of woody plants and environmental variables for 118 quadrats (each of 25,000 km(2)) across southern Africa, and used structural equation models (SEMs) and spatial regressions to examine the relationship between the species richness of woody plants and of mammal trophic guilds (herbivores, insectivores, carni/omnivores) and habitat guilds (aquatic/fossorial, ground-living, climbers, aerial), after controlling for environment. We compared the results of SEMs with those of single-predictor regressions (without controlling for environment) and of spatial regressions (controlling for both environment and residual spatial autocorrelation).
   Results
   The geographical variation of mammal species richness in southern Africa was strongly and positively related to that of woody plant species richness, and this relationship held for most mammal guilds even when the influence of environment and spatial autocorrelation had been accounted for. However, the effect of woody plant species richness on the richness of aquatic/fossorial species almost disappeared after controlling for environment, suggesting that the congruence in species richness patterns between these two groups results from similar responses to the same environmental variables. For many mammal guilds, the relative role of environmental predictors as measured by standardized partial regression coefficients changed depending on whether non-spatial single-predictor regressions, non-spatial SEMs, or spatial regressions were used.
   Main conclusions
   Woody plants are important determinants of the species richness of most mammal guilds in southern Africa, even when controlling for environment and residual spatial autocorrelation. Environmental correlates with animal species richness as measured by simple correlations or single-predictor regressions might not always reflect direct effects; they might, at least to some degree, result from indirect effects via woody plants. Interpretations of the strength of the effect of environmental variables on mammal species richness in southern Africa depend largely on whether spatial or non-spatial models are used. We therefore stress the need for caution when interpreting environmental 'effects' on broad-scale patterns of species richness if spatial and non-spatial methods yield contrasting results.

AB P>1. It is generally believed that warmer climate forests suffer more herbivory, as a proportion of leaf area, than cooler climate forests. However, standardized studies using the same methodology have rarely been performed.
   2. We carried out a study on scattered forest-edge populations of four widespread tree species (Quercus alba, Acer rubrum, Fagus grandifolia and Liquidambar styraciflua) spanning 17 degrees of latitude in North America.
   3. We sampled early summer sun leaves (12 weeks after bud break) at each latitude in 2 years. Total insect folivory damage was estimated from the percentage area damaged in fresh leaves on forest edges, using a scanner-linked software.
   4. The percentage area damage per leaf of all four species in both years shows a significant latitudinal trend, with less damage in lower latitude areas of eastern North America. This is contrary to what would generally be expected according to current ecological thinking. Among the four studied species, only A. rubrum showed a significant difference between the 2 years.
   5. Synthesis. The observation of an inverse latitudinal trend may have wider implications for the study of community functioning, suggesting that strength of 'biotic' interaction between plants and herbivores might actually be no less important, or in fact more important, in cool temperate climates compared with warm temperate climates.

AB P> Why some species become invasive is a timely question in ecology. Most hypotheses assume that changed ecological interactions, especially enemy release, allow species to become invasive. This paper investigates how the release from a specialist frugivore may lead to relaxed selection on avoidance and defence strategies in an invasive plant.
   Silene latifolia was introduced from Europe to North America where its main enemies are absent. Reintroduced North American plants suffer greater damage than European plants by their specialist frugivore Hadena bicruris, which lays eggs in flowers. However, the mechanism is unclear: increased oviposition preference, decreased defence leading to higher egg and larval survival, or a closer phenological match.
   We exposed plants from European and North American populations to this enemy by allowing natural oviposition and also by manually adding eggs. We recorded reproductive traits potentially associated with interactions with the seed predator and monitored the different stages of fruit attack (oviposition, larval growth and survival) to study the relative roles of increased attractiveness versus decreased defence.
   North American plants received significantly more eggs (40.2 +/- 2.1 eggs per plant) than European plants (28.4 +/- 3.0 eggs per plant) and natural fruit predation was twice as high on North American than on European plants. Oviposition preference rates for North American over European plants persisted also after variation in flower size and phenology were accounted for.
   European and North American plants did not differ significantly in larval survival, larval mass at emergence or in the rate of defensive fruit abscission, indicating that greater susceptibility of plants from the introduced range to the seed predator is largely due to an increased preference for oviposition rather than to changes in palatability or defence after oviposition.
   Synthesis. Our results are consistent with the idea that introduced plants may evolve after introduction, if evolutionary constraints such as those imposed by plant-frugivore interactions, are broken down in the invasive range. For S. latifolia, release from its native predator H. bicruris may have allowed evolution of increased attractiveness to pollinators without the burden of attracting the frugivore.

AB The combination of varying aquatic habitats and flow regimes creates a complex stimulus environment from which sensory information can be extracted. Previous studies with crayfish in artificial stream settings have shown that altering the temporal and spatial structure of an odor plume modifies orientation behavior. Exposure to more temporally complex odor signals enables crayfish to locate food more efficiently. To link these studies to a more natural setting, we examined how odor signals are dispersed in 3 physically different habitats within the Maple River in Pellston, Michigan, USA, by simultaneously measuring flow patterns and odor plume characteristics. These microhabitats consisted of sections of the stream with gravel, transition (gravel and sand), or sand substrate. Flow measurements were taken using an Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter while simultaneous in situ odor plume measurements were made with an Epsilon electrochemical system. Flow had more turbulent energy in gravel and transition habitats than in sand habitat. Mean velocity was significantly higher in gravel (67.8 +/- 2.00 cm/s) than in transition (30.5 +/- 0.46 cm/s) and sand (30.6 +/- 0.27 cm/s) habitats. In addition, eddy diffusivity rates were higher in gravel (173.3 cm(2)/s(3) than in sand (9.74 cm(2)/s(3)) and transition (129.7 cm(2)/s(3)) habitats. Differences in turbulent flow profoundly affected the fine-scale distribution of the chemical signal. The concentration of dopamine tracer in odor pulses was significantly lower in sand (range: 8.1-6.9 mu mol/L) and transition (range: 26.2-8.9 mu mol/L) habitats than in gravel (range: 46.5-5.39 mu mol/L) habitat. Background (natural) concentrations of dopamine are undetectable with our current technology. Furthermore, spectral density of odor pulses showed larger fluctuations in chemical concentration at all frequencies (0.1-10 Hz) in gravel habitat than in sand or transition habitats. Our results illustrate the dynamic nature of turbulence structure within natural stream systems and its influence on the distribution of chemical odor signals. Our results provide evidence that natural stream settings influence both the distribution and concentration of chemical odors available for ecological and behavioral interactions. The combination of turbulence and odor plume variation creates habitat-specific information that influences orientation behavior of organisms within a river.

AB Our study presents experimentally based results on how large herbivore species affect savanna vegetation and thus murid rodents in the Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. We permanently excluded groups of large herbivore guilds of various body sizes (ranging from white rhino to hares) from sixteen 40 x 40-m plots of vegetation by using different fence types. We determined grass species composition and vegetation height and collected capture-mark-recapture data on murid rodents. Nutrient concentrations of the dominant grass species and rodent diet compositions were analysed. We found that herbivore species of different body sizes had different effects on murid rodents. The exclusion of medium-sized herbivores, such as warthog, impala and nyala increased the abundance of high-quality grass species, especially Panicum maximum. However, the dominant rodent species Lemniscomys rosalia preferred the most abundant grass species, rather than high-quality grasses. The absence of large bulk feeders, such as zebra, buffalo and white rhino led to an increase in vegetation height. In response. tall vegetation promoted both rodent abundance and species diversity and altered rodent species composition. Ultimately, our results indicate that the greatest effect on murid rodents came from the reduction of vegetation cover by large bulk feeders, which likely increased rodent predation risk.

AB Ecological interactions between yucca moths (Tegeticula, Prodoxidae) and their host plants (Yucca, Agavaceae) are exemplary of obligate plant-pollinator mutualism and co-evolution. We describe a multiplex microsatellite DNA protocol for species identification and sibship assignment of sympatric larvae from Tegeticula synthetica and Tegeticula antithetica, pollinators of the Joshua tree (Yucca brevifolia). Bayesian clustering provides correct diagnosis of species in 100% of adultmoths, with unambiguous identification of sympatric larvae. Sibship assignments show that larvae within a single fruit are more likely to be full-sibs or half-sibs than larvae from different fruit, consistent with the hypothesis that larval clutches are predominantly the progeny of an individual female.

AB Host trees for obligate epiphytes are dynamic patches that emerge, grow and fall, and metacommunity diversity critically depends on efficient dispersal. Even though species that disperse by large asexual diaspores are strongly dispersal limited, asexual dispersal is common. The stronger dispersal limitation of asexually reproducing species compared to species reproducing sexually via small spores may be compensated by higher growth rates, lower sensitivity to habitat conditions, higher competitive ability or younger reproductive age. We compared growth and reproduction of different groups of epiphytic bryophytes with contrasting dispersal (asexual vs. sexual) and life history strategies (colonists, short- and long-lived shuttle species, perennial stayers) in an old-growth forest stand in the boreo-nemoral region in eastern Sweden. No differences were seen in relative growth rates between asexual and sexual species. Long-lived shuttles had lower growth rates than colonists and perennial stayers. Most groups grew best at intermediate bark pH. Interactions with other epiphytes had a small, often positive effect on growth. Neither differences in sensitivity of growth to habitat conditions nor differences in competitive abilities among species groups were found. Habitat conditions, however, influenced the production of sporophytes, but not of asexual diaspores. Presence of sporophytes negatively affected growth, whereas presence of asexual diaspores did not. Sexual species had to reach a certain colony size before starting to reproduce, whereas no such threshold existed for asexual reproduction. The results indicate that the epiphyte metacommunity is structured by two main trade-offs: dispersal distance vs. reproductive age, and dispersal distance vs. sensitivity to habitat quality. There seems to be a trade-off between growth and sexual reproduction, but not asexual. Trade-offs in species traits may be shaped by conflicting selection pressures imposed by habitat turnover and connectivity rather than by species interactions.

AB The degree to which biotic interactions influence invasion by non-indigenous species may be partly explained by the evolutionary relationship of these invaders with natives. Darwin's naturalization hypothesis controversially proposes that non-native plants are more likely to invade if they lack close relatives in their new range. A possible mechanism for this pattern is that exotics that are more closely related to natives are more likely to share their herbivores, and thus will suffer more damage than phylogenetically isolated species. We tested this prediction using exotic plants in Ontario, Canada. We measured herbivore damage to 32 species of exotic plants in a common garden experiment, and 52 in natural populations. We estimated their phylogenetic distances from locally occurring natives in three ways: as mean distance (age) to all native plants, mean distance to native members of the same family, and distance to the closest native species. In the common garden, the proportion of leaves damaged and the average proportion of leaf area damaged declined with mean phylogenetic distance to native family relatives by late summer. Distance to native confamilials was a better predictor of damage than distance to the closest native species, while mean distance to the entire native plant community failed to predict damage. No significant patterns were detected for plants in natural populations, likely because uncontrolled site-to-site variation concealed these phylogenetic trends. To the extent that herbivory has negative demographic impacts, these results suggest that exotics that are more phylogenetically isolated from native confamilials should be more invasive; conversely, native communities should be more resistant to invasion if they harbor close familial relatives of potential invaders. However, the large scatter in this relationship suggests that these often are likely to be weak effects; as a result, these effects often may be difficult to detect in uncontrolled surveys of natural populations.

AB We used an individual-based spatially-explicit model to assess the role of facilitation and plant strategies in shaping the 'community biomass-species richness' relationship. Facilitation had few impacts on community's richness under both the most benign (high community biomass) and the most severe (low community biomass) environments where its intensity was weak. From medium to high environmental severity, facilitation increased community richness, because all plant strategies were facilitated. In contrast, from low to medium environmental severity facilitation decreased community richness, because only the most competitive species were facilitated, which induced a decrease in the richness of the stress-tolerant species overwhelming the increase in richness of the competitive species. Above all, our simulations show how 'strategy-dependent' interactions among species combine to shape the humped-back biomass-species richness relationship. It also demonstrates that facilitative effects might have long-term negative effects on species richness, which result is not included in current facilitation models.

AB Fruit consumption by birds is an important ecological interaction that contributes to seed dispersal in tropical rainforests. In this field experiment, we asked whether moderate human disturbance alters patterns of avian frugivory: we measured fruit removal by birds in the lower montane rainforest of Tobago, West Indies, using artificial infructescences made with natural fruits from two common woody plants of the forest understory (Psychotria spp., Rubiaceae). Displays were mounted simultaneously in three forest habitats chosen to represent a gradient of increasing habitat disturbance (primary, intermediate and disturbed), caused by subsistence land use adjacent to a protected forest reserve. We measured the numbers of fruits removed and the effect of fruit position on the likelihood of removal, along with the abundances of all fruits and fruit-eating birds at the study sites. Fruit removal was highly variable and there was not a significant difference in removal rate among forest habitats; however, the trend was for higher rates of removal from displays in primary forest. Canopy cover, natural fruit availability, and frugivore abundance were not good predictors of fruit removal. Birds preferred more accessible fruits (those proximal to the perch) in all habitats, but in disturbed forest, there was a tendency for distal fruits to be chosen more frequently than in the other forest types. One possible explanation for this pattern is that birds in disturbed forests were larger than those in other habitats, and hence were better able to reach the distal fruits. Coupled with differences in bird community composition among the forest types, this suggests that different suites of birds were removing fruit in primary versus disturbed forest. As frugivore species have different effectiveness as seed dispersers, the among-habitat differences in fruit removal patterns that we observed could have important implications for plant species experiencing disturbance; these possible implications include altered amounts of seed deposition and seedling recruitment in Tobago's tropical rainforest.

AB Novel concepts and tools to promote progress in grazing science and management need to incorporate heterogeneity and nonlinear scaling of spatially and temporally distributed ecological interactions such as diet selection, defoliation, and plant growth. Traditional grazing management factors are number of animals, species and category of animals, spatial distribution of forage demand, and temporal distribution of forage demand. These traditional methods have been based on a paradigm that is static, assumes equilibrium conditions, and does not consider scaling issues, neither in time nor in space. Three related issues that can contribute to the progress in the understanding and management of grazing systems are spatial heterogeneity, event-driven dynamics, and scaling effects. Spatial heterogeneity of species and defoliation determine pasture stability by modulating competition and response to heterogeneous defoliation. When pasture species are well mixed, livestock are less able to select their preferred diet. When species are separated into larger and more easily identifiable patches, the selected diet approaches the preferred one. Simultaneously, patchiness in pasture components and redistribution of nutrients by grazing can lend global compositional stability to grass-clover pastures. Grazing at high animal density can be studied using the paradigm of event-driven dynamics. Several mechanisms suggest that grazing systems should have allometric spatial and temporal scaling in addition to the well-recognized allometric scaling of food requirements with body mass. Grazing system performance should scale allometrically with pasture size because both resource distribution and animal movements frequently have fractal properties. As pasture size increases, fewer hierarchical levels of grazing behavior are constrained, and the new spatial patterns introduce nonlinearity in the response to pasture size. Operant conditioning of foraging behavior, conditioned aversions, plant spatial pattern, pasture size and shape, timing and duration of grazing periods, and number of animals are discussed as precision tools to manage grazing systems.

AB Structural properties of the cordgrass, Spartina foliosa, were studied in parallel with nitrogen fixation rates and diversity of nitrogen-fixing microbes (diazotrophs) for two years in sediments of an early successional (6 year old) and a mature marsh at Tijuana Estuary (California, USA) via acetylene reduction and genetic fingerprinting (T-RFLP with nifH). Nitrogen fixation rates reflected biannual dynamics and differences in S. foliosa between marshes. In initial comparisons (fall 2005), S. foliosa height and aboveground biomass were less developed and average nitrogen fixation rates were higher in the early successional marsh than in its mature counterpart. By the following fall (2006), sediment organic content, nitrogen fixation rates and total rhizosphere diversity were similar between marshes, but S. foliosa aboveground biomass and porewater ammonium remained lower in the early successional marsh and diazotrophic community composition differed significantly. Diazotroph assemblages in surface sediments consistently differed from those in S. foliosa rhizospheres of the late-successional marsh, but not in the younger marsh, where rhizosphere diazotroph richness (T-RFs) declined from 2005 to 2006 in parallel with aboveground biomass of S. foliosa plants. These dynamics of diazotroph communities and S. foliosa suggest that ecological interactions of microbes and plants significantly influence wetland ecosystem function and succession.

AB Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) is a measure of the deviation from perfect bilateral symmetry, and has been used across mammals as a reliable indicator of environmental stress during growth and development. Antler size and symmetry can be an indicator of individual fitness and social rank among ungulates such as the North American elk Cervus elaphus. When environmental conditions are favourable, ungulates allocate additional resources to antler development to increase secondary Sexual traits and enhance reproduction. We tested whether there was an appreciable change in antler length and the number of points as extreme climatic conditions (e.g. heavy snow and drought) reduced the nutritional condition of elk using 8,690 antler measurements collected at hunter check stations in south-central Montana surrounding the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE) during 1982-2006. We also hypothesized that FA in elk antlers would increase at high elk density because of density-dependent competition for food. We developed a priori general linear models of FA expressed as a function of climate covariates, elk density and relevant ecological interactions between the variables. In contrast to previous studies, especially of European ungulates, our results show little support for strong effects of climate or density oil FA in length or the number of points. Thus, North American elk do not appear to respond to environmental variation by varying allocation to antler growth, instead they show stronger age-related effects oil FA.

AB Environmental amenity-driven migration presents a double-edged sword to policy makers concerned with both economic and ecological sustainability. Clearly the protection of environmental amenities is important, but what is the right balance between ecosystem protection and regional economic processes that simultaneously respond to and degrade ecological resources? We consider this question in the context of households that are attracted to a region by urban and lake amenities and a lake ecosystem that becomes degraded by land development. An analytical expression for the time evolution of population is derived from households' and firms' optimizing behaviors. Numerical methods with phase plane diagrams are used to study the steady state and transient dynamics of the resulting population-phosphorus coupled system. The system is found to be bi-stable under a range of parameter values with one attractor corresponding to a desired "balanced" economy-ecology state and the other to a very small population base with fully restored ecology. We examine the dynamics and quantify the resilience of the system in and away from the balanced steady state using phase plane diagrams that demarcate the two domains of attraction. Economic-ecological interactions fundamentally alter regional economic dynamics and influence the resilience of the balanced domain of attraction, For example, a one percent increase in the loadings coefficient associated with residential land development generates a three percent decline in the resilience of the balanced state. We find that economic feedbacks often increase system resilience. Initial increases in the attraction of urban amenities spur greater population growth that increases the resilience of the balanced state. In addition, price feedbacks that arise from capitalized (dis)amenities increase the resilience of the system to bad ecological shocks. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Climate change will modify ecosystems, but a dearth of long-term data sets on critical ecological factors makes prediction of mechanistic pathways and scope for ecological changes difficult. Using 14-18 year time series of phytoplankton abundance and mussel recruitment at up to 10 sites along 320 km of coast in a rocky intertidal ecosystem, we examined the influence of climatic variation at 3-7 year (El Nino-Southern Oscillation [ENSO]), 7-10 year (North Pacific Gyre Oscillation [NPGO]), and 20+ year (Pacific Decadal Oscillation [PDO]) timescales. Phytoplankton and mussel recruitment revealed order-of-magnitude increases and seasonal shifts in the 2000s compared to 1989-1999, but seasonal shifts were in opposite directions with phytoplankton blooms occurring earlier and recruitment occurring later in the year. The NPGO had the strongest relationships with both phytoplankton and recruitment, while relationships between these factors and ENSO and PDO were weak. Increases were associated with cooler ocean temperature and intensification in the ocean gyre-scale circulation reflected in a stronger North Pacific Current (NPC). Phytoplankton abundance and mussel recruitment were positively correlated, suggesting that increases in larval food may have driven the changes in mussel recruitment. With our prior demonstration that mussel growth rate is sensitive to phytoplankton concentration, these results suggest an important effect of bottom-up forcing on the dynamics of coastal mussel populations. We conclude that central supply-side ecological processes in coastal ecosystems are sensitive to long-term ocean basin-scale oceanographic and atmospheric fluctuation. Despite these changes, intertidal community dynamics have changed only in relatively subtle ways, suggesting a role for local ecological interactions in dampening the effects of dominant modes of climate forcings in coastal ecosystems.

AB We develop a modeling framework that estimates the effects of species identity and diversity on ecosystem function and permits prediction of the diversity-function relationship across different types of community composition. Rather than just measure an overall effect of diversity, we separately estimate the contributions of different species interactions. This is especially important when both positive and negative interactions occur or where there are patterns in the interactions. Based on different biological assumptions, we can test for different patterns of interaction that correspond to the roles of evenness, functional groups, and functional redundancy. These more parsimonious descriptions can be especially useful in identifying general diversity-function relationships in communities with large numbers of species. We provide an example of the application of the modeling framework. These models describe community-level performance and thus do not require separate measurement of the performance of individual species. This flexible modeling approach can be tailored to test many hypotheses in biodiversity research and can suggest the interaction mechanisms that may be acting.

AB 1. Characterisation of biodiversity is typically based on taxonomic approaches, while much less is known about other related aspects. Functional trait diversity is one such component of biodiversity that has not been addressed rigorously in ecological research until recently. We tested the congruence between taxonomic- and trait-based approaches, and examined how spatial configuration, local abiotic environmental factors and biotic effects interact to influence taxonomic- and trait-based characterisation of freshwater fish assemblages.
   2. Fish assemblage data were compiled for 124 lakes in southern Finland. Variance partitioning in both linear regression analyses and redundancy analysis was used to quantify the relative contribution of spatial and environmental variables to taxonomic and functional trait diversity and structure. Additionally, a null model analysis was used to test for the potential effects of interspecific segregation and biotic interactions on the co-occurrence of species.
   3. The species pool was relatively poor. However, trait-based classification of species indicated that most species belonged to unique functional entities, which suggested low redundancy in species composition. Correlation analysis indicated a very strong relationship between species richness (SR) and the number of unique trait combinations (UTC). Ecoregion-level heterogeneity in SR and UTC were well represented in a relatively small group of randomly selected lakes (c. 30 lakes). Multiple regressions indicated moderate roles for abiotic environmental variables (i.e. lake surface area, depth, total phosphorous, colour and pH) in determining SR, UTC and the distribution of single trait categories, whereas geographical location was not generally influential.
   4. Redundancy analysis revealed similar patterns to those of diversity analyses for taxonomic and associated trait-based structure, emphasising the effect of abiotic environmental variables and the negligible effect of geographical position.
   5. Co-occurrence analysis indicated significant checkerboard distribution at the whole assemblage level, but interspecific segregation proved to be of relatively minor importance in the constrained analyses, where species pair combinations within trait category groups were evaluated.
   6. Our results suggest that taxonomic- and trait-based patterns of boreal lake fish assemblages are strongly interrelated. Environmental filtering through the effects of local abiotic variables seems to have the most prominent role in determining trait-based assemblage patterns among lakes, which may also be secondarily shaped by biotic interactions.
   7. From the applied perspective, it may not necessarily matter whether traditional taxonomic or more novel trait-based approaches are used in characterising spatial patterns in boreal fish assemblages. However, trait-based approaches may provide complementary information which cannot be directly revealed by taxonomic data.

AB We investigated changes in the occurrence of allelochemicals from leachates of different Pinus halepensis organs taking into account the stages of pine stand age (i.e., young < 15-years-old, middle age +/- 30-years, and old > 60-years-old). GC-MS analysis of aqueous extracts revealed approx. 59 components from needles and roots. The major constituents were divided into different phytochemical groups-phenolics (50%), fatty acids (44%), and terpenoids. Further analyses were carried out to characterize the distribution of allelochemicals in different organs and P. halepensis successional stages. Roots and needles had two distinct chemical profiles, while needle leachates were composed mainly of oxygenated terpenoids (e.g., alpha-eudesmol, alpha-cadinol, and alpha-terpineol). Roots mainly contained fatty acids. Needles from young pine stands had the highest content of monoterpenes, suggesting their role as potential allelochemicals that could help young pine stands to establish. Pooling the different functional chemical groups showed that needles and, to a lesser extent, old roots, had higher chemical diversity than the roots of young and medium-aged pines. The highest diversity in phenolic constituents and fatty acids was in young needles (D-chem = 2.38). Finally, caffeic acid, a compound that has allelopathic properties was found in aqueous extracts at high concentrations in both young needles and old roots. The role of this compound in mediation of biological interactions in P. halepensis ecosystem functioning is discussed.

TI Insights into succession processes using temporally repeated habitat

AB Questions
   The early phases of primary succession are governed by chance events and dispersal-related processes in an environment that is largely free of competition. Thus, the predictability of vegetation patterns using environmental site factors can be expected to be low and spatial autocorrelation to be high. We asked whether the match between vegetation and environment becomes better in the course of succession, and whether vegetation types shift their realized niche with time.
   Location
   Lignite mining region in Central Germany, the post-mining landscape "Goitzsche" (Saxony-Anhalt).
   Methods
   Vegetation types were mapped in a 10-m grid (total area 4.8 ha), starting in 1995, at 3-year intervals until 2007. We used a temporal comparison of habitat models. We applied: GLS regression to partition the variation in coverage of vegetation types into environmental (soil pH) and spatial components; logistic regression to model the presence/absence of vegetation types along a soil acidity gradient; and autologistic regression allowing for soil acidity and neighbourhood effects.
   Results
   For most vegetation types, the proportion of variation explained by space was high but declined during succession. The outcome of autologistic models suggests that soil acidity often plays a minor role compared to neighbourhood effects in the earlier phase of succession than 12 years later. For four vegetation types, the pH range in which the type was expected to be dominant clearly became smaller with time. These trends support the view that the role of processes related to chance and dispersal decrease with time, while those related to environmental filtering mediated by biotic interactions increase.
   Conclusions
   We conclude that temporal comparisons of spatially explicit habitat models provide insights into changing biotic community processes and their effects on habitat specificity of species or their communities. Thus, this approach may be particularly important for analysis of ecological systems that are not in equilibrium with their environmental drivers.

AB Habitat loss and fragmentation lead to changes in species richness and composition which may affect ecosystem services. Yet, few studies distinguish between the effects of habitat loss and isolation, or how multiple ecosystem services may be affected simultaneously. We investigated the effects of variation in cover of woody and open semi-natural habitats and isolation from forest on the relative functioning of pollination, seed predation and insect scavenging in agricultural landscapes. We established 30 sites in grassland locations in the Swiss plateau around Berne. The sites varied independently in their isolation from forest edges, in the percentage of woody habitats and in the percentage of open semi-natural habitats in the surrounding landscape (500 m radius). We experimentally exposed primroses, sunflower seeds and cricket corpses during spring 2008. None of the three studied services was affected by variation in woody or open semi-natural habitat cover. However, the proportion of flowers setting seed was significantly reduced by isolation from forest. Further, seed predation and insect scavenging were significantly lower at isolated sites than at sites connected to woody habitat. This pattern was particularly pronounced for seeds and insect corpses that were enclosed by wire netting and thus inaccessible to vertebrates. Thus, all three studied services responded quite similarly to the landscape context. The observed small-scale determination of seed set, seed predation and insect scavenging contrasts with larger-scale determination of pollination and insect pest control found in other studies.

AB While changes in spring phenological events due to global warming have been widely documented, changes in autumn phenology, and therefore in growing season length, are less studied and poorly understood. However, it may be helpful to assess the potential lengthening of the growing season under climate warming in order to determine its further impact on forest productivity and C balance. The present study aimed to: (1) characterise the sensitivity of leaf phenological events to temperature, and (2) quantify the relative contributions of leaf unfolding and senescence to the extension of canopy duration with increasing temperature, in four deciduous tree species (Acer pseudoplatanus, Fagus sylvatica, Fraxinus excelsior and Quercus petraea). For 3 consecutive years, we monitored the spring and autumn phenology of 41 populations at elevations ranging from 100 to 1,600 m. Overall, we found significant altitudinal trends in leaf phenology and species-specific differences in temperature sensitivity. With increasing temperature, we recorded an advance in flushing from 1.9 +/- A 0.3 to 6.6 +/- A 0.4 days A degrees C-1 (mean +/- A SD) and a 0 to 5.6 +/- A 0.6 days A degrees C-1 delay in leaf senescence. Together both changes resulted in a 6.9 +/- A 1.0 to 13.0 +/- A 0.7 days A degrees C-1 lengthening of canopy duration depending on species. For three of the four studied species, advances in flushing were the main factor responsible for lengthening canopy duration with increasing temperature, leading to a potentially larger gain in solar radiation than delays in leaf senescence. In contrast, for beech, we found a higher sensitivity to temperature in leaf senescence than in flushing, resulting in an equivalent contribution in solar radiation gain. These results suggest that climate warming will alter the C uptake period and forest productivity by lengthening canopy duration. Moreover, the between-species differences in phenological responses to temperature evidenced here could affect biotic interactions under climate warming.

AB Global environmental changes, such as rising atmospheric CO(2) concentrations, have a wide range of direct effects on plant physiology, growth, and fecundity. These environmental changes also can affect plants indirectly by altering interactions with other species. Therefore, the effects of global changes on a particular species may depend on the presence and abundance of other community members. We experimentally manipulated atmospheric CO(2) concentration and amounts of herbivore damage (natural insect folivory and clipping to simulate browsing) to examine: (1) how herbivores mediate the effects of elevated CO(2) (eCO(2)) on the growth and fitness of Arabidopsis thaliana; and (2) how predicted changes in CO(2) concentration affect plant resistance to herbivores, which influences the amount of damage plants receive, and plant tolerance of herbivory, or the fitness consequences of damage. We found no evidence that CO(2) altered resistance, but plants grown in eCO(2) were less tolerant of herbivory-clipping reduced aboveground biomass and fruit production by 13 and 22%, respectively, when plants were reared under eCO(2), but plants fully compensated for clipping in ambient CO(2) (aCO(2)) environments. Costs of tolerance in the form of reduced fitness of undamaged plants were detected in eCO(2) but not aCO(2) environments. Increased costs could reduce selection on tolerance in eCO(2) environments, potentially resulting in even larger fitness effects of clipping in predicted future eCO(2) conditions. Thus, environmental perturbations can indirectly affect both the ecology and evolution of plant populations by altering both the intensity of species interactions as well as the fitness consequences of those interactions.

AB Current predictions regarding the ecological consequences of climate change on animal populations are generally autecological and species-specific, and/or non-mechanistic extrapolations of recent short-term patterns. To better understand and predict the effects of climate change on the distribution of species and the abundance of populations we offer a novel, broad theoretical framework. Climate-induced changes in trophic structure may actually be more predictable than effects on individual species. The logic is that there are general differences in climatic sensitivity among trophic levels - specifically, that as one moves up trophic levels, there is an increase in the temperature sensitivity of vital rates. More precisely, we provide: (1) a formal mathematical definition of distribution limits that is both operational and conceptual, introducing the concept DL50, defined as the geographic and climatic isoline representing an equilibrium occupancy of half of the suitable habitats; (2) a matrix of the possible changes in trophic structure from climate change and the general theoretical consequences; and (3) a new idea that predicts broad effects of climatic warming on trophic systems. Our intention is to help meet the challenge of developing and testing general theoretical models that can predict which species will be winners and losers in ecological time, which evolutionary traits will be favoured or selected against, and what will be consequences for ecosystem structure and function.

AB Trans-generational effects on immunity are well known in vertebrates and are considered in many evolutionary and ecological theories of species interaction. Maternal effects have been identified to be of special importance, and are now recognized as a mechanism for adaptive phenotypic response to environmental heterogeneity. We have previously shown that exposure to dietary non-pathogenic bacteria can induce several aspects of immune response in an insect herbivore, the cabbage semilooper (Trichoplusia ni). Here, we test the effects of this exposure on the immune status of the next generation, measuring immune parameters on three different levels-enzyme activities, protein expression and transcript abundance. We also monitored fitness-related traits which are often negatively correlated with increased immunocompetence. We found evidence for trans-generational priming on all these levels, with immune system parameters that are clearly not transmitted in a 1 : 1 ratio from parent to offspring, but rather in a complex manner with a strong but not exclusive maternal component. These findings indicate that trans-generational priming is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon, potentially playing a role as a long-term but non-genetic mode of environmental adaptation.

AB Fire has been the dominant disturbance in boreal America since the Pleistocene, resulting in a spatial mosaic in which the most fire occurs in the continental northwest. Spatial variation in snowshoe hare ( Lepus americanus) density reflects the fire mosaic. Because fire initiates secondary forest succession, a fire mosaic creates variation in the abundance of early successional plants that snowshoe hares eat in winter, leading to geographic variation in hare density. We hypothesize that fire is the template for a geographic mosaic of natural selection: where fire is greatest and hares are most abundant, hare browsing has most strongly selected juvenile-phase woody plants for defense. We tested the hypothesis at multiple spatial scales using Alaska birch (Betula neoalaskana) and white birch (Betula papyrifera). We also examined five alternative hypotheses for geographic variation in antibrowsing defense. The fire-hare-defense hypothesis was supported at transcontinental, regional, and local scales; alternative hypotheses were rejected. Our results link transcontinental variation in species interactions to an abiotic environmental driver, fire. Intakes of defense toxins by Alaskan hares exceed those by Wisconsin hares, suggesting that the proposed selection mosaic may coincide with a geographic mosaic of coevolution.

AB The features that govern the stability and persistence of species interaction networks, such as food webs, remain elusive, but recent work suggests that the distribution and strength of trophic links play an important role. Potential omnivory-stability relationships have been investigated and debated extensively, but we still have a relatively poor understanding of how levels of omnivory relate to the stability of diverse food webs. Here, we use an evolutionary assembly model to investigate how different trade-offs in resource use influence both food web structure and dynamic stability during the assembly process. We build on a previous model by allowing speciation along with the evolution of two traits: body size and feeding-niche width. Across a wide range of conditions, the level of omnivory in a food web is positively related to its dynamic instability (variability and species turnover). Parameter values favoring omnivory also allow a wider range of phenotypes to invade, often displacing existing species. This high species turnover leaves signatures in reconstructed phylogenies, with shorter branches connecting extant species in more omnivorous food webs. Our findings suggest that features of the environment may influence both trophic structure and dynamic stability, leading to emergent omnivory-stability relationships.

AB The vast majority of plant and animal species reproduce sexually despite the costs associated with sexual reproduction. Genetic recombination might outweigh these costs if it helps the species escape parasite pressure by creating rare or novel genotypes, an idea known as the Red Queen hypothesis. Selection for recombination can be driven by short- and long-term effects, but the relative importance of these effects and their dependency on the parameters of an antagonistic species interaction remain unclear. We use computer simulations of a mathematical model of host-parasite coevolution to measure those effects under a wide range of parameters. We find that the real driving force underlying the Red Queen hypothesis is neither the immediate, next-generation, short- term effect nor the long-term effect but in fact a delayed short- term effect. Our results highlight the importance of differentiating clearly between immediate and delayed short- term effects when attempting to elucidate the mechanism underlying selection for recombination in the Red Queen hypothesis.

AB Plant-pollinator interactions provide ideal frameworks for studying interactions in plant communities. Despite the large potential influence of such interactions on plant community structure, biodiversity and evolutionary processes, we know surprisingly little about the relative importance of positive and negative interactions among plant species for pollinator attraction. Therefore, we explored the relationships between conspecific and heterospecific floral densities and the flower visitation rates of nine plant species mainly visited by bumble bees, and six plant species mainly visited by flies, in a temperate grassland, through stepwise multiple regressions. Significant relationships were interpreted as interactions for pollinator attraction. Our results revealed that positive intra- and interspecific interactions for pollinator attraction were far more frequent than negative ones. Seventeen interspecific interactions were revealed of which 14 were significantly positive, whereas three of four significant intraspecific interactions were positive. Seven species experienced only positive interactions and two species experienced only negative interactions. The results presented here indicate that negative interactions are not necessarily the dominant ecological interaction for pollination among plants within a community, and the study represents a straightforward approach to study intra- and interspecific interactions among multiple species within a community. We discuss which mechanisms may drive the positive interactions for pollinator attraction and whether this may result in facilitative effects on reproductive success.

AB The monitoring of desertification processes, and particularly the development of "early-warning'' systems, is an increasingly important development in the management of drylands. It has been shown that the patch size distribution of dryland vegetation can be described using power laws and that deviations from such patterns may be used as an early-warning signal for the onset of desertification. We tested this idea using data from 29 semiarid steppes located along a latitudinal gradient in Spain. A truncated power law (TPL) fitted the patch size distribution of perennial vegetation better than a power law in all the evaluated sites. Variations in this distribution, as measured with the scaling exponent (gamma) of the TPL, were not related to total perennial cover, but a negative logarithmic relationship was found between gamma and soil variables related to desertification processes (total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and organic carbon). A positive and stronger linear relationship was found between total perennial cover and the same soil variables. Our results suggest that deviations from a patch size distribution characterized by a power law are not directly related to desertification. They also indicate that plant cover can be used to effectively monitor key variables linked to desertification processes.

AB Plant species composition and diversity is often influenced by early life history stages; thus, global change could dramatically affect plant community structure by altering seed production. Unfortunately, plant reproductive responses to global change are rarely studied in field settings, making it difficult to assess this possibility. To address this issue, we quantified the effects of elevated CO2, nitrogen deposition, and declining diversity on inflorescence production and inflorescence mass of 11 perennial grassland species in central Minnesota, USA. We analyzed these data to ask whether (1) global change differentially affects seed production of co-occurring species; (2) seed production responses to global change are similar for species within the same functional group (defined by ecophysiology and growth form); and (3) seed production responses to global change match productivity responses. We found that, on average, allocation to seed production decreased under elevated CO2, although individual species responses were rarely significant due to low power (CO2 treatment df = 2). The effects of nitrogen deposition on seed production were similar within functional groups: C-4 grasses tended to increase while C-3 grasses tended to decrease allocation to seed production. Responses to nitrogen deposition were negatively correlated to productivity responses, suggesting a trade-off. Allocation to seed production of some species responded to a diversity gradient, but responses were uncorrelated to productivity responses and not similar within functional groups. Presumably, species richness has complex effects on the biotic and abiotic variables that influence seed production. In total, our results suggest that seed production of co-occurring species will be altered by global change, which may affect plant communities in unpredictable ways. Although functional groups could be used to generalize seed production responses to nitrogen deposition in Minnesota prairies, we caution against relying on them for predictive purposes without a mechanistic understanding of how resource availability and biotic interactions affect seed production.

AB Development of theory has outpaced experimental tests for most maintenance of diversity mechanisms. Here we demonstrate how data from biodiversity-ecosystem functioning experiments can be used to determine the mechanisms that maintain plant species diversity. We hypothesized that grassland plant diversity is maintained by two classes of mechanisms: (1) equalizing mechanisms, which reduce asymmetric competition by reducing differences in monoculture biomass production among species in mixture, and (2) species interaction mechanisms, which increase overyielding by increasing niche partitioning and facilitation among species in mixture. Specifically, equalizing mechanisms reduce the coefficient of variation in monoculture biomass production among species in mixture. Species interaction mechanisms increase species overyielding in mixture, especially for low-biomass species. We tested these predictions with a seven-year data set from an experiment that varied grassland plant species evenness and richness. We used path analysis to model effects of these mechanisms on annual and multiyear changes in diversity. We found that diversity was frequently maintained by species interaction mechanisms and was infrequently maintained by equalizing mechanisms. Species interaction mechanisms maintained diversity by allowing the species that produced the least biomass in monoculture to benefit the most from species interactions in mixture. Equalizing mechanisms infrequently maintained diversity because asymmetric competition infrequently resulted in competitive exclusion. We propose that this mechanistic framework be used to better understand the specific processes that influence diversity.

AB Higher trophic level species such as parasites, parasitoids, and pathogens are frequently ignored in community studies, despite playing key roles in the structure, function, and stability of ecological communities. Furthermore, such species are typically among the last in a community to reestablish due to their reliance upon lower trophic level resources and a requirement for persistent, stable ecological conditions. Consequently their presence alone can be indicative of healthy ecosystems. Using replicated, quantitative food webs we studied the impacts of a restoration treatment upon the interactions of a tri-trophic community consisting of plants, their bumble bee pollinators, and the parasites, parasitoids, and pathogens of the bumble bees at heathland sites. We found the lower trophic levels of the community successfully reinstated at restored relative to control sites. However the abundance, load per host, prevalence of parasitism, prevalence of superparasitism, and host range of a key dipteran parasitoid of the family Conopidae were all significantly reduced in restored heathlands. Potential causes for this incomplete reestablishment at restored sites include the lag in floral resources due to differences in. oral species composition, and the reduced ability of this parasitoid species in accessing host resources relative to other natural enemy species present in these communities. Moreover the incomplete reinstatement of the natural enemy community was found to significantly reduce levels of network vulnerability (a measure of how vulnerable prey is to being consumed) at restored sites relative to ancient, control networks.

AB Spatial variation in the frequency and outcome of interspecific interactions is thought to play a central role in shaping geographic patterns of biodiversity. Previous empirical studies and modeling exercises suggest that negative species interactions should occur with greater frequency and intensity in high-quality/low-stress environments. I tested this hypothesis through a four-year epidemiological study of interactions between the plant Hesperolinon californicum and the pathogenic rust fungus Melampsora lini. By virtue of its association with serpentine soils, H. californicum is exposed to edaphic conditions that are stressful to most plants. Notable among these is the low availability of calcium, an element that plays critically important roles in the immune responses of plants to attacking pathogens. As a serpentine generalist, however, H. californicum grows in soils with a wide range of calcium concentrations, and this should lead to differences in the frequency and/or severity of rust infection among host populations. I investigated geographic variation in disease pressure by conducting annual surveys in 16 populations spanning the host's distribution and representing a range of soil calcium concentrations. Results indicated that plants growing in more stressful low-calcium soils experienced higher rates of rust infection, suggesting that soil calcium may modulate host susceptibility in a manner opposite to that predicted by the a priori hypothesis. Epidemiological surveys further revealed a latitudinal cline in disease prevalence, with high infection rates in northern host populations decreasing gradually toward the south. Studies of the fitness effects of disease demonstrated that rust infection caused significant reductions in host survival and fecundity, and there was evidence of a demographic feedback between infection prevalence and host density across survey years.

AB Ecological network patterns are influenced by diverse processes that operate at different temporal rates. Here we analyzed whether the coupled effect of local abundance variation, seasonally phenotypic plastic responses, and species evolutionary adaptations might act in concert to shape network patterns. We studied the temporal variation in three interaction properties of bird species (number of interactions per species, interaction strength, and interaction asymmetry) in a temporal sequence of 28 plant-frugivore interaction networks spanning two years in a Mediterranean shrubland community. Three main hypotheses dealing with the temporal variation of network properties were tested, examining the effects of abundance, switching behavior between alternative food resources, and morphological traits in determining consumer interaction patterns. Our results demonstrate that temporal variation in consumer interaction patterns is explained by short-term variation in resource and bird abundances and seasonal dietary switches between alternative resources (fleshy fruits and insects). Moreover, differences in beak morphology are associated with differences in switching behavior between resources, suggesting an important role of foraging adaptations in determining network patterns. We argue that beak shape adaptations might determine generalist and specialist feeding behaviors and thus the positions of consumer species within the network. Finally, we provide a preliminary framework to interpret phylogenetic signal in plant-animal networks. Indeed, we show that the strength of the phylogenetic signal in networks depends on the relative importance of abundance, behavioral, and morphological variables. We show that these variables strongly differ in their phylogenetic signal. Consequently, we suggest that moderate and significant phylogenetic effects should be commonly observed in networks of species interactions.

AB Diamond [Assembly of species communities. In: Ecology and Evolution of Communities (eds Cody, M.L. & Diamond, J.M.). Harvard University Press, Cambridge, pp. 342-444] proposed that resource competition leads to checkerboard-like distributions of competing species. This proposal prompted research that revealed checkerboard patterns within a wide range of communities, but the mechanisms that generate such patterns are still poorly understood. Here we present whole-lake natural experiments and analyses of species-environment relationships in small coastal lake fish communities that were fragmented when land uplift isolated these lakes from the Baltic Sea, showing that a combination of predation and habitat suitability generated checkerboard distributions. Checkerboard patterns developed because two piscivores, northern pike and Eurasian perch, caused the extinction of several prey species in deep lakes. Conversely, low oxygen levels in shallow lakes caused extinction of the piscivores, and these areas served as a refuge for tolerant prey species. Based on these findings, we suggest that habitat suitability and biotic interactions should be viewed simultaneously in null models of assembly rules.

AB 1. Understanding relationships between resource and consumer diversity is essential to predicting how changes in resource diversity might affect several trophic levels and overall ecosystem functioning.
   2. We tested for the effects of leaf litter species diversity (i.e. litter mixing) on litter mass remaining and macroinvertebrate communities (taxon diversity, abundance and biomass) during breakdown in a detritus-based headwater stream (North Carolina, U.S.A.). We used full-factorial analyses of single- and mixed-species litter from dominant riparian tree species with distinct leaf chemistries [red maple (Acer rubrum), tulip poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), chestnut oak (Quercus prinus) and rhododendron (Rhododendron maximum)] to test for additivity (single-species litter presence/absence effects) and non-additivity (emergent effects of litter species interactions).
   3. Significant non-additive effects of litter mixing on litter mass remaining were explained by species composition, but not richness, and litter-mixing effects were variable throughout breakdown. Specifically, small differences in observed versus expected litter mass remaining were measured on day 14; whereas observed litter mass remaining in mixed-species leaf packs was significantly higher on day 70 and lower on day 118 than expected from data for single-species leaf packs.
   4. Litter mixing had non-additive effects on macroinvertebrate community structure. The number of species in litter mixtures (two to four), but not litter species composition, was a significant predictor of the dominance of particular macroinvertebrates (i.e. indicator taxa) within mixed-species packs.
   5. In addition, the presence/absence of high- (L. tulipifera) and low-quality (R. maximum) litter had additive effects on macroinvertebrate taxon richness, abundance and biomass. The presence of L. tulipifera litter had both positive (synergistic) and negative (antagonistic) effects on invertebrate taxon richness, that varied during breakdown but were not related to litter chemistry. In contrast, the presence/absence of L. tulipifera had a negative relationship with total macroinvertebrate biomass (due to low leaf mass remaining when L. tulipifera was present and higher condensed and hydrolysable tannins associated with leaf packs lacking L. tulipifera). Macroinvertebrate abundance was consistently lower when R. maximum was present, which was partially explained by litter chemistry [e.g., high concentrations of lignin, condensed tannins, hydrolysable tannins and total phenolics and high carbon to nutrient (N and P) ratios].
   6. The bottom-up effects of litter species diversity on stream macroinvertebrates and litter breakdown are different, which suggests that structural attributes of macroinvertebrate communities may only partially explain the effects of litter-mixing on organic matter processing in streams. In addition, stream macroinvertebrates colonising decomposing litter are influenced by resource diversity as well as resource availability. Broad-scale shifts in riparian tree species composition will alter litter inputs to streams, and our results suggest that changes in the diversity and availability of terrestrial litter may alter stream food webs and organic matter processing.

AB Aim To determine whether the diversity of resident and transient coral-dwelling fish responds differentially to gradients in regional species richness.
   Location Three regions in the Indo-Pacific (Red Sea, western Indian Ocean, Great Barrier Reef) which contain increasingly larger regional diversities of reef fish.
   Methods I surveyed fish residing within branching coral species. Fish species were a priori categorized as resident or transient based on the degree of affiliation between the fish and live coral. To compare among regions that differ in coral diversity I used a modified species-volume relationship (SVR). Each point in the SVR represents the total number of fish species, resident or transient, found within the cumulative volume of a specific coral species. Empirical SVRs were further compared with random-placement null models.
   Results For transient species, I found that the observed SVRs did not differ consistently from those expected from random samples drawn from the corresponding regional species pools. In addition, for a given volume of coral, more fish species were found in richer regions, indicating strong regional influences on local diversity. In contrast, resident richness was lower than that expected from random samples of the species pool, and richness in rich regions was reduced comparably more than in poor regions. The SVRs of resident species were similar among regions with different regional diversities.
   Main conclusion These results suggest that, within coral species, transient fish richness is mostly influenced by stochastic allocation of species from the regional pool. Conversely, richness of resident species within a coral species is limited, making it independent of regional diversity. Since higher regional diversity of resident fish was not accompanied by higher richness per coral species or by decreased niche breadth, higher regional diversity of resident fish species must be rooted in higher coral richness. Consequently, ecological interactions between functional groups (coral and fish) can be powerful drivers of regional biodiversity.

AB Aim We examined whether species occurrences are primarily limited by physiological tolerance in the abiotically more stressful end of climatic gradients (the asymmetric abiotic stress limitation (AASL) hypothesis) and the geographical predictions of this hypothesis: abiotic stress mainly determines upper-latitudinal and upper-altitudinal species range limits, and the importance of abiotic stress for these range limits increases the further northwards and upwards a species occurs.
   Location Europe and the Swiss Alps.
   Methods The AASL hypothesis predicts that species have skewed responses to climatic gradients, with a steep decline towards the more stressful conditions. Based on presence-absence data we examined the shape of plant species responses (measured as probability of occurrence) along three climatic gradients across latitudes in Europe (1577 species) and altitudes in the Swiss Alps (284 species) using Huisman-Olff-Fresco, generalized linear and generalized additive models.
   Results We found that almost half of the species from Europe and one-third from the Swiss Alps showed responses consistent with the predictions of the AASL hypothesis. Cold temperatures and a short growing season seemed to determine the upper-latitudinal and upper-altitudinal range limits of up to one-third of the species, while drought provided an important constraint at lower-latitudinal range limits for up to one-fifth of the species. We found a biome-dependent influence of abiotic stress and no clear support for abiotic stress as a stronger upper range-limit determinant for species with higher latitudinal and altitudinal distributions. However, the overall influence of climate as a range-limit determinant increased with latitude.
   Main conclusions Our results support the AASL hypothesis for almost half of the studied species, and suggest that temperature-related stress controls the upper-latitudinal and upper-altitudinal range limits of a large proportion of these species, while other factors including drought stress may be important at the lower range limits.

AB Emerging infectious diseases threaten human and wildlife populations. Altered ecological interactions between mutualistic microbes and hosts can result in disease, but an understanding of interactions between host, microbes and disease-causing organisms may lead to management strategies to affect disease outcomes. Many amphibian species in relatively pristine habitats are experiencing dramatic population declines and extinctions due to the skin disease chytridiomycosis, which is caused by the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. Using a randomized, replicated experiment, we show that adding an antifungal bacterial species, Janthinobacterium lividum, found on several species of amphibians to the skins of the frog Rana muscosa prevented morbidity and mortality caused by the pathogen. The bacterial species produces the anti-chytrid metabolite violacein, which was found in much higher concentrations on frog skins in the treatments where J. lividum was added. Our results show that cutaneous microbes are a part of amphibians' innate immune system, the microbial community structure on frog skins is a determinant of disease outcome and altering microbial interactions on frog skins can prevent a lethal disease outcome. A bioaugmentation strategy may be an effective management tool to control chytridiomycosis in amphibian survival assurance colonies and in nature.

TI Separating the influences of environment and species interactions on
   patterns of distribution and abundance: competition between large

AB Much recent research has focused on the use of species distribution models to explore the influence(s) of environment (predominantly climate) on species' distributions. A weakness of this approach is that it typically does not consider effects of biotic interactions, including competition, on species' distributions.
   Here we identify and quantify the contribution of environmental factors relative to biotic factors (interspecific competition) to the distribution and abundance of three large, wide-ranging herbivores, the antilopine wallaroo (Macropus antilopinus), common wallaroo (Macropus robustus) and eastern grey kangaroo (Macropus giganteus), across an extensive zone of sympatry in tropical northern Australia.
   To assess the importance of competition relative to habitat features, we constructed models of abundance for each species incorporating habitat only and habitat + the abundance of the other species, and compared their respective likelihoods using Akaike's information criterion. We further assessed the importance of variables predicting abundance across models for each species.
   The best-supported models of antilopine wallaroo and eastern grey kangaroo abundance included both habitat and the abundance of the other species, providing evidence of interspecific competition. Contrastingly, models of common wallaroo abundance were largely influenced by climate and not the abundance of other species. The abundance of antilopine wallaroos was most influenced by water availability, eastern grey kangaroo abundance and the frequency of late season fires. The abundance of eastern grey kangaroos was most influenced by aspects of climate, antilopine wallaroo abundance and a measure of cattle abundance.
   Our study demonstrates that where census and habitat data are available, it is possible to reveal species' interactions (and measure their relative strength and direction) between large, mobile and/or widely-distributed species for which competition is difficult to demonstrate experimentally. This allows discrimination of the influences of environmental factors and species interactions on species' distributions, and should therefore improve the predictive power of species distribution models.

AB 1. Although necessary for understanding and predicting population dynamics, abiotic and biotic interactions have only rarely been coupled to demography and population dynamics.
   2. We estimated effects of 11 environmental factors on survival, growth and fertility of the perennial herb Actaea spicata and incorporated significant factors into integral projection models to assess their effect on population dynamics.
   3. Statistical models suggested that high soil potassium concentration increased individual growth and that seed predation and, to a lesser extent, canopy cover reduced seed production.
   4. Demographic models showed that both soil potassium concentration and pre-dispersal seed predation could reverse population growth from positive to negative. The observed range of soil potassium concentration corresponded to growth rates (lambda) between 0.96 and 1.07, at mean observed seed predation intensity. At observed mean potassium concentration, growth rate ranged from 0.99 to 1.02 over observed seed predation intensities.
   5. Sensitivity of population growth rate to different vital rates strongly influenced the relative effects of the two factors. Elasticity analysis suggested that proportional changes in soil potassium concentration result in seven times larger effects on population growth rate than changes in seed predation.
   6. Synthesis. We conclude that relatively weak associations between environmental factors and vital rates can have substantial long-term effects on population growth. Approaches based on detailed demographic models, that simultaneously assess abiotic and biotic effects on population growth rate, constitute important tools for establishing the links between the environment and dynamics of populations and communities.

AB Recent publications indicate that inter-specific interactions between soil bacteria may strongly affect the behavior of the strains involved, e. g., by increased production of antibiotics or extracellular enzymes. This may point at an enhanced competitive ability due to inter-specific triggering of gene expression. However, it is not known if such inter-specific interactions also occur during competition for carbon which is the normal situation in soil. Here, we report on competitive interactions between two taxonomically non-related bacterial strains, Pseudomonas sp. A21 and Pedobacter sp. V48, that were isolated from a dune soil. The strains showed strong effects on each other's behavior and gene expression patterns when growing together under carbon-limited conditions on agar. The most pronounced observed visual changes in mixed cultures as compared to monocultures were (1) strong inhibition of a bioindicator fungus, suggesting the production of a broad-spectrum antibiotic, and (2) the occurrence of gliding-like movement of Pedobacter cells. Two independent techniques, namely random arbitrary primed-PCR (RAP-PCR) and suppressive subtractive hybridization (SSH), identified in total 24 genes that had higher expression in mixed cultures compared to monocultures. Microbial interactions were clearly bidirectional, as differentially expressed genes were detected for both bacteria in mixed cultures. Sequence analysis of the differentially expressed genes indicated that several of them were most related to genes involved in motility and chemotaxis, secondary metabolite production and two-component signal transduction systems. The gene expression patterns suggest an interference competition strategy by the Pseudomonas strain and an escape/explorative strategy by the Pedobacter strain during confrontation with each other. Our results show that the bacterial strains can distinguish between intra- and inter-specific carbon competition.

AB Mangrove sediment is well known for its susceptibility to anthropogenic pollution, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), but knowledge of the sediment microbial community structure with regards to exposure to PAHs is limited. The study aims to assess the effects of PAHs on the bacterial community of mangrove sediment using both 16s rDNA polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) and traditional enrichment methods. Both the exposure time and the PAH concentration reduced the microbial diversity, as determined by the DGGE bands. Although PAHs could act as carbon sources for microorganisms, PAHs, at a concentration as low as 20 mg l(-1), posed a toxic effect to the microbial community. Sequencing of DGGE bands showed that marine bacteria from the genera of Vibrio, Roseobacter, and Ferrimonas were most abundant after PAH exposure, which suggests that both marine and terrestrial bacteria coexisted in the mangrove sediment, but that the marine microbes were more difficult to isolate using the traditional culture method. DGGE determination further demonstrated that the consistency among triplicates of the enriched consortia was significantly less than that of the sediment slurries. The present study reveals that the mangrove sediment microbial structure is susceptible to PAH contamination, and complex microbial community interactions occur in mangrove sediment.

AB The stress-gradient hypothesis (SGH) predicts a shift from predominant competition to facilitation as abiotic stress increases. Most empirical tests of the SGH have evaluated the interactions between a single or a few pairs of species, have not considered the effects of multiple stress factors, and have not explored these interactions at nested spatial scales. We sampled 63 0.25-m(2) plots, each subdivided into 100 5x5 cm and 25 10x10 cm sampling squares, in a semi-arid Mediterranean environment to evaluate how co-occurrence patterns among biological soil crusts (BSC)-forming lichens changed along natural stress gradients driven by water and nutrient (N, P, K) availability. According to the SGH, we tested the hypothesis that the fine-scale spatial arrangement of BSC-forming lichens should shift from prevailing interspecific segregation to aggregation as abiotic stress increases. Co-occurrence patterns ranged from significant species segregation to aggregation at the two spatial scales studied. When using the 5x5 cm grid, more plots showed significant species segregation than aggregation. At this sampling scale, co-occurrence increased as water and nutrient availability decreased and increased, respectively. Small increases in soil pH promoted species co-occurrence. Interspecific segregation was promoted as the cover of highly competitive species, such as Diploschistes diacapsis, increased. No significant relationships between co-occurrence and the surrogates of abiotic stress were observed when data was arranged in a 10x10 cm grid. Our co-occurrence analyses partially supported predictions from the SGH, albeit the results obtained were dependent on the type of abiotic stress and the spatial scale considered. They show the difficulties of predicting how co-occurrence patterns change along complex stress gradients, and highlight the need of incorporating the effects of abiotic stress promoted by different resources, such as water and nutrients, into the conceptual framework of the SGH.

AB I investigated a multi-behavioral game between predators and prey that integrated both pre-encounter and post-encounter behaviors. These behaviors included landscape-scale movements by predators and prey, a type of prey vigilance that increases immediately after an encounter and then decays over time ('ratcheting vigilance'), and predator management of prey vigilance. I analyzed the game using a computer-based evolutionary algorithm. This algorithm embedded an individual-based model of ecological interactions within a dynamic adaptive process of mutation and selection. I investigated how evolutionarily stable strategies (ESS) varied with the predators' learning ability, killing efficiency, density and rate of movement. I found that when predators learn prey location, random prey movement can be an ESS. Increased predator killing efficiency reduced prey movement, but only if the rate of predator movement was low. Predators countered ratcheting vigilance by delaying their follow-up attacks; however, this delay was reduced in the presence of additional predators. The interdependence of pre-and post-encounter behaviors revealed by the evolutionary algorithm suggests an intricate co-evolution of multi-behavioral predator-prey behavioral strategies.

AB Many invertebrates avoid predation risk by seeking and defending refuges that can be in limited supply, producing strong intra- and inter-specific interference competition. Previous experimental studies in central Chile demonstrated that interference competition for refuges is the primary factor driving habitat segregation between the predatory crabs Acanthocyclus gayi and A. hassled, with the latter species monopolizing galleries inside mussel beds in the mid intertidal zone and limiting A. gayi to rock crevices. Yet, habitat partitioning between rival species can result from differences in habitat preferences and not solely from interference interactions. Moreover, since A. gayi is also known to shelter in turf-forming algae (predominantly Gelidium), which dominates extensive areas in the low intertidal zone, among-sites variation in the turf morphology and abundance could modify habitat preferences and the pattern of inter-specific interactions. We experimentally evaluated refuge habitat preferences of individual, similarly-sized adult A. gayi and A. hassleri in the laboratory, comparing choice patterns across multiple trials with paired combinations of the main refuge types commonly used by crabs in the field: a) mussel galleries, b) rock crevices, c) short algal turf, and d) tall algal turf Our results showed that both species display a strong ranking of preferences for some refuge habitats over others. In general, mussel galleries were the preferred refuge type for both crab species, but their preference rankings changed depending on turf morphology. When turf was short, A. hassleri and A. gayi made identical refuge choices, strongly preferring mussel galleries over crevices and these over the short turf. In contrast, when the turf was tall A. gayi selected equally the tall turf or mussel galleries, and these were strongly preferred over crevices. A. hassleri, on the other hand, largely ignored tall turf and kept the highest preference for mussel galleries. A field experiment in which crabs were offered to foraging birds demonstrated that A. hassleri is more susceptible than A. gayi to predation by kelp gulls when outside refuges. Differences in patterns of coloration between crabs may underlie between-species differences in predation susceptibility and their habitat choices. These results suggest that the among-site differences in turf morphology (height and shape of fronds), which is largely driven by varying intensity of upwelling, could affect crab preferences for refuge habitats and the relative importance of inter-specific interference competition.

AB Spatial structure has been identified as a major contributor to the maintenance of diversity. Here, we show that the impact of spatial structure on diversity is strongly affected by the ecological mechanisms maintaining diversity. In well-mixed, unstructured environments, microbial populations can diversify by production of metabolites during growth, providing additional resources for novel specialists. By contrast, spatially structured environments potentially limit such facilitation due to reduced metabolite diffusion. Using replicate microcosms containing the bacterium Escherichia coli, we predicted the loss of diversity during an environmental shift from a spatially unstructured environment to spatially structured conditions. Although spatial structure is frequently observed to be a major promoter of diversity, our results indicate that it can also have negative impacts on diversity.

AB In reservoirs, variations in water level may affect plankton biomass and species composition. Studies on the effect of water-level fluctuations are scarce and restricted to Europe and Australia. In the Rio Tercero Reservoir (Argentina), the management policies of a nuclear-power plant require a minimum depth of 650 m. During periods of excessive rainfall, however, the input is such that the excess passes over the spillway, thus causing a high turnover of water. Phytoplankton, zooplankton, and physicochemical variables were monitored over 2 years at three sampling stations during a period with annual precipitation higher than the historical annual mean. Different hydrological situations occurred based on precipitation, spillway outflow, and water-renewal rate. At high renewal rates, phyto- and zoo-plankton diversities peaked. During high outflow periods phytoplankton biomass peaked through the contribution of Ceratium hirundinella. Once the spillway outflow ceased, stable conditions (low renewal rates) were achieved, thus allowing the onset of biological interactions. Maximum phytoplankton density (mainly Actinocyclus normanii) was reached at such times, and efficient grazers (Daphnia laevis) with long life cycles dominated in terms of biomass. The structure and dynamics of the plankton community could be altered by changes in hydrological conditions (renewal rate and spillway outflow) that act to compromise the apparent stability imposed by steady water levels. These variables must be considered to identify disturbance conditions and improve knowledge of reservoir environments, so as to implement appropriate management practices.

AB Pest management is expensive and there is often uncertainty about the benefits for the resources being protected. There can also be unintended consequences for other parts of the ecosystem, especially in complex food webs. In making decisions managers generally have to rely on qualitative information collected in a piecemeal fashion. A method to assist decision making is a qualitative modelling approach using fuzzy cognitive maps, a directed graphical model related to neural networks that can take account of interactions between pests and conservation assets in complex food webs. Using all available information on relationships between native and exotic resources and consumers, we generated hypotheses about potential consequences of single-species and multi-species pest control on the long-term equilibrium abundances of other biotic components of an ecosystem. We applied the model to a dryland ecosystem in New Zealand because we had good information on its trophic structure, but the information on the strength of species interactions was imprecise. Our model suggested that pest control is unlikely to significantly boost native invertebrates and lizards in this ecosystem, suggesting that other forms of management may be required for these groups. Most of the pest control regimes tested resulted in greater abundances of at least one other pest species, which could potentially lead to other management problems. Some of the predictions were unexpected, such as more birds resulting from possum and mouse control. We also modelled the effects of an increase in invasive rabbits, which led to unexpected declines of stoats, weasels, mice and possums. These unexpected outcomes resulted from complex indirect pathways in the food web. Fuzzy cognitive maps allow rapid construction of prototype models of complex food webs using a wide range of data and expert opinion. Their utility lies in providing direction for future monitoring efforts and generating hypotheses that can be tested with field experiments.

AB Sustainability is said to be the science of integration, be it integration of scale, discipline or of stakeholders' interests. One way to integrate such diverse elements is to develop sustainable development indicators. Numerous national and international organizations have attempted to develop such indicators, among which interaction indicators are of critical importance because they enable us to link up human activities, ecological dynamics, and social goals. Among the various ways to develop such indicators, the most common ones are the pressure-state-response (PSR) indicators, as well as others coming from this framework. With realistic methodology one shall observe how PSR indicators might appear as an operational tool to face rapid social and ecological changes within a French biosphere reserve in Brittany. Results suggest that such a framework is insufficient to describe, understand and manage social and ecological interactions.

AB Our understanding of fire and grazing is largely based on small-scale experimental studies in which treatments are uniformly applied to experimental units that are considered homogenous. Any discussion of an interaction between fire and grazing is usually based on a statistical approach that ignores the spatial and temporal interactions on complex landscapes. We propose a new focus on the ecological interaction of fire and grazing in which each disturbance is spatially and temporally dependent on the other and results in a landscape where disturbance is best described as a shifting mosaic (a landscape with patches that vary with time since disturbance) that is critical to ecological structure and function of many ecosystems. We call this spatiotemporal interaction pyric herbivory (literal interpretation means grazing driven by fire). Pyric herbivory is the spatial and temporal interaction of fire and grazing, where positive and negative feedbacks promote a shifting pattern of disturbance across the landscape. We present data we collected from the Tallgrass Prairie Preserve in the southern Great Plains of North America that demonstrates that the interaction between free-roaming bison (Bison bison) and random fires promotes heterogeneity and provides the foundation for biological diversity and ecosystem function of North American and African grasslands. This study is different from other studies of fire and grazing because the fires we examined were random and grazing animals were free to roam and select from burned and unburned patches. For ecosystems across the globe with a long history of fire and grazing, pyric herbivory with any grazing herbivore is likely more effective at restoring evolutionary disturbance patterns than a focus on restoring any large vertebrate while ignoring the interaction with fire and other disturbances.

ID CLIMATE-CHANGE; UNCERTAINTIES; SHIFTS; KAPPA
AB BIOMOD is a computer platform for ensemble forecasting of species distributions, enabling the treatment of a range of methodological uncertainties in models and the examination of species-environment relationships. BIOMOD includes the ability to model species distributions with several techniques, test models with a wide range of approaches, project species distributions into different environmental conditions (e.g. climate or land use change scenarios) and dispersal functions. It allows assessing species temporal turnover, plot species response curves, and test the strength of species interactions with predictor variables. BIOMOD is implemented in R and is a freeware, open source, package.

TI Properties of native plant communities do not determine exotic success

AB Considerable research has been devoted to understanding how plant invasions are influenced by properties of the native community and to the traits of exotic species that contribute to successful invasion. Studies of invasibility are common in successionally stable grasslands, but rare in recently disturbed or seral forests. We used 16 yr of species richness and abundance data from 1 m(2) plots in a clearcut and burned forest in the Cascade Range of western Oregon to address the following questions: 1) is invasion success correlated with properties of the native community? Are correlations stronger among pools of functionally similar taxa (i.e. exotic and native annuals)? Do these relationships change over successional time? 2) Does exotic abundance increase with removal of potentially dominant native species? 3) Do the population dynamics of exotic and native species differ, suggesting that exotics are more successful colonists? Exotics were primarily annual and biennial species. Regardless of the measure of success (richness, cover, biomass, or density) or successional stage, most correlations between exotics and natives were non-significant. Exotic and native annuals showed positive correlations during mid-succession, but these were attributed to shared associations with bare ground rather than to direct biotic interactions. At peak abundance, neither cover nor density of exotics differed between controls and plots from which native, mid-successional dominants were removed. Tests comparing nine measures of population performance (representing the pace, magnitude, and duration of population growth) revealed no significant differences between native and exotic species. In this early successional system, local richness and abundance of exotics are not explained by properties of the native community, by the presence of dominant native species, or by superior colonizing ability among exotics species. Instead natives and exotics exhibit individualistic patterns of increase and decline suggesting similar sets of life-history traits leading to similar successional roles.

AB Climate change and invasive species are two stressors that should have large impacts on native species in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. We quantify and integrate the effects of climate change and the establishment of an invasive species (smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu) on native lake trout Salvelinus namaycush populations. We assembled a dataset of almost 22 000 Canadian lakes that contained information on fish communities, lake morphologies, and geography. We examined the pelagic-benthic and littoral forage fish community available to lake trout populations across three lake size classes in these aquatic ecosystems. Due to the decreased presence of alternate prey resources, lake trout populations residing in smaller lakes are more vulnerable to the effects of smallmouth bass establishment. A detailed spatially and temporally explicit approach to assess smallmouth bass invasion risk in Ontario lakes suggests that the number of Ontario lakes with vulnerable lake trout populations could increase from 118 (similar to 1%) to 1612 (similar to 20%) by 2050 following projected climate warming. In addition, we identified nearly 9700 lake trout populations in Canada threatened by 2100, by the potential range expansion of smallmouth bass. Our study provides an integration of two major stressors of ecosystems, namely climate change and invasive species, by considering climate-change scenarios, dispersal rates of invasive species, and inter-specific biotic interactions.

AB Community ecology has long focused on energy and nutrients as currencies of species interactions. Evidence from physiological ecology and recent studies suggest that in terrestrial systems, water may influence animal behavior and global patterns of species richness. Despite these observations, water has received little attention as a currency directly influencing animal species interactions. Here, we show that the per capita interaction strength between predatory wolf spiders and their primary prey, field crickets, is strong (-0.266) when predators and prey are maintained in ambient dry conditions, but is near zero (0.001) when water is provided ad libitum. Moreover, crickets consume 31-fold more moist leaf material in ambient dry conditions, switching from old litter to moist green leaves when free water is scarce. Under dry conditions, animals may make foraging decisions based first on water needs, not energy or nutrients, suggesting strong and predictable effects of alterations in aridity on species interactions.

AB Theory suggests that the spatial context within which species interactions occur will have major implications for the outcome of competition and ultimately, coexistence, but empirical tests are rare. This is surprising given that individuals of species in real communities are typically distributed nonrandomly in space. Nonrandom spatial arrangement has the potential to modify the relative strength of intra- and interspecific competition by changing the ratio of conspecific to heterospecific competitive encounters, particularly among sessile species where interactions among individuals occur on local scales. Here we test the influence of aggregated and random spatial arrangements on population trajectories of competing species in benthic, marine, sessile-invertebrate assemblages. We show that the spatial arrangement of competing species in simple assemblages has a strong effect on species performance: when conspecifics are aggregated, strong competitors perform poorly and weaker competitors perform better. The effect of specific spatial arrangements depends on species identity but is also strongly context dependent. When there are large differences in species competitive ability, aggregated spatial arrangements can slow competitive exclusion, and so nonrandom spatial arrangement can work synergistically with other trade-off based mechanisms to facilitate coexistence.

AB 1. Understanding factors that regulate the assembly of communities is a main focus of ecology. Human-engineered habitats, such as reservoirs, may provide insight into these assembly processes because they represent novel habitats that are subjected to colonization by fishes from the surrounding river basin or transported by humans. By contrasting community similarity within and among reservoirs from different drainage basins to nearby stream communities, we can test the relative constraints of reservoir habitats and regional species pools in determining species composition of reservoirs.
   2. We used a large spatial database that included intensive collections from 143 stream and 28 reservoir sites within three major river basins in the Great Plains, U.S.A., to compare patterns of species diversity and community structure between streams and reservoirs and to characterize variation in fish community structure within and among major drainage basins. We expected reservoir fish faunas to reflect the regional species pool, but would be more homogeneous that stream communities because similar species are stocked and thrive in reservoirs (e.g. planktivores and piscivores), and they lack obligate stream organisms that are not shared among regional species pools.
   3. We found that fish communities from reservoirs were a subset of fishes collected from streams and dominant taxa had ecological traits that would be favoured in lentic environments. Although there were regional differences in reservoir fish communities, species richness, patterns of rank abundance and community structure in reservoir communities were more homogonous across three major drainage basins than for stream communities.
   4. The general pattern of convergence of reservoir fish community structure suggests their assembly is constrained by local factors such as habitat and biotic interactions, and facilitated by the introduction of species among basins. Because there is a reciprocal transfer of biota between reservoirs and streams, understanding factors structuring both habitats is necessary to evaluate the long-term dynamics of impounded river networks.

AB Most models of thermal adaptation ignore biotic interactions, and those that do consider biotic interactions assume that competitors or predators cannot respond to adaptation by the focal species. Nevertheless, real biotic interactions involve responsive entities, which can be more accurately modelled using evolutionary game theory.
   We present a two-part analysis of a thermal game between prey and predators. First, we model a game in which prey choose patches on the basis of operative temperature and predation risk, whereas predators choose patches on the basis of prey density. Second, we consider how this thermal game influences the evolution of the prey's thermal physiology.
   The solution of the thermal game is an evolutionarily stable Nash equilibrium in which prey divide their time equally among a range of thermal patches while predators bias their hunting efforts toward warmer patches, even though they derive no thermoregulatory benefit from doing so. Furthermore, the optimal range of temperatures selected by prey and predators increases as the lethality of predators increases.
   This thermal game potentially influences the evolution of the prey's thermal physiology. When predators are less lethal, prey should thermoregulate over a narrower range of temperatures, resulting in selection for thermal specialization of physiological performance. But when predators are very lethal, prey should thermoregulate over a broad range of temperatures; in this case, prey pay no fitness cost for being thermal generalists.
   Evolutionary game theory provides a powerful tool for generating hypotheses about the effects of biotic interactions on evolution in heterogeneous environments.

AB We addressed two poorly understood aspects of plant response to climate change: the impact of extreme climatic events and the mediating role of biotic interactions, through a study of heatwave effects on tree seedling survival rates and ability of the tree canopy to alter seedling responses.
   Mountain belt of the northern French Alps (Maurienne Valley).
   The survival rates of two seedling cohorts from four tree species (Abies alba, Acer pseudoplatanus, Fraxinus excelsior and Picea abies) were measured during both the 2003 European heatwave and an average summer (2004) in deciduous broadleaf mountain forests. Seedlings were transplanted into two soil moisture conditions, and in experimental gaps or under the tree canopy.
   The heatwave strongly decreased tree seedling survival rates, while there was an important species-specific mediating role of biotic interactions. In the wettest conditions, the tree canopy strongly increased survival of Abies, buffering the negative impact of the heatwave. In contrast, in the driest conditions, the tree canopy decreased survival of Picea and Acer, amplifying the negative impact of the heatwave. We found evidence of increasing soil water stress in the understorey of the driest community, but further studies including vapour pressure deficit measurements are needed to elucidate the driving mechanism of facilitation.
   The high species specificity of the mediating role of biotic interactions and its variation along stress gradients leads to questions on our ability to predict large-scale responses of species to climate changes.

AB One of the most difficult interactions to observe in nature is the relationship between a predator and its prey. When direct observations are impossible, we rely on morphological classification of prey remains, although this is particularly challenging among generalist predators whose faeces contain mixed and degraded prey fragments. In this investigation, we used a polymerase chain reaction and sequence-based technique to identify prey fragments in the guano of the generalist insectivore, the eastern red bat (Lasiurus borealis), and evaluate several hypotheses about prey selection and prey defences. The interaction between bats and insects is of significant evolutionary interest because of the adaptive nature of insect hearing against echolocation. However, measuring the successes of predator tactics or particular prey defences is limited because we cannot normally identify these digested prey fragments beyond order or family. Using a molecular approach, we recovered sequences from 89% of the fragments tested, and through comparison to a reference database of sequences, we were able to identify 127 different species of prey. Our results indicate that despite the robust jaws of L. borealis, most prey taxa were softer-bodied Lepidoptera. Surprisingly, more than 60% of the prey species were tympanate, with ears thought to afford protection against these echolocating bats. Moths of the family Arctiidae, which employ multiple defensive strategies, were not detected as a significant dietary component. Our results provide an unprecedented level of detail for the study of predator-prey relationships in bats and demonstrate the advantages which molecular tools can provide in investigations of complex ecological systems and food-web relationships.

AB The relative importance of positive and negative interaction in species assemblages is thought to be dependent on the harshness of the physical environment. I studied the consistency of this prediction in a field experiment using growth of the target species Warnstorfia exannulata as influenced by the presence or absence of two adjacent species, Sphagnum warnstorfii and Scapania undulata. In particular, I focused on the mechanism by which colony-colony interactions occur, elucidating how the balance of positive and negative interactions changes along a water gradient. Because the natural fluctuations of the environment modify the water gradient, it was expected that the competitive hierarchies of the species would not remain consistent over time. Results indicated that the different hydrological properties of the colonies, thought to be the necessary condition for the appearance of species interactions, were not sufficient to explain the outcome of the species interactions. The switch from competition to facilitation under more stressful conditions was not confirmed along a water stress gradient. In addition, natural climatic fluctuations, by affecting the length of the water gradient, changed the competitive hierarchies of the species on a seasonal scale.

AB We investigated how ecological realism might impact the outcome of three experimental manipulations of species richness to determine whether the patterns and the mechanisms underlying richness-variability relationships differ as ecological communities are increasingly exposed to external forces that may drive richness-variability patterns in nature. To test for such an effect, we conducted experiments using rock pool meio-invertebrate communities housed in three experimental venues: controlled laboratory microcosms, artificially constructed rock pools in the field, and naturally occurring rock pools in the field. Our results showed that experimental venue can have a strong effect on the outcome of richness manipulation experiments. As ecological realism increased, the strength of the relationship between species richness and community variability declined from 32.9% in the laboratory microcosms to 16.8% in the artificial pools to no effect of species richness on community variability in the natural rock pools. The determinants of community variability also differed as ecological realism increased. In laboratory microcosms, community variability was driven solely by mechanisms related to increasing species richness. In artificial rock pools, community variability was driven by a combination of direct and indirect environmental factors as well as mechanisms related to increasing species richness. In the natural rock pools community variability was independent of species richness and was only related to environmental factors. In summary, we found that stabilizing mechanisms associated with species interactions were influential in establishing species richness-variability relations only in the less realistic experimental venues (the laboratory microcosms and the artificial rock pools in the field), and that these mechanisms diminished in importance as ecological realism and complexity of the experimental venue increased. Our results suggest that the effects of diversity might be more difficult to detect in natural systems due to the combined effects of biotic and abiotic forcing, which can mask our ability to detect richness effects.

   resolving the paradox of parasite survival?

AB Parasite virulence determines both the impact that parasites have on their hosts and parasite fitness. While most studies of virulence have involved single-species host-parasite interactions, the majority of parasites are likely to use multiple concurrent host species. Our understanding of how this impacts on parasite epidemiology and virulence is limited. Using the bumble bee Bombus lucorum, which exists in sympatry with B. terrestris in multi-species assemblages, and their generalist micosporidian parasite Nosema bombi, we tested whether the apparent paradox of parasite maintenance due to parasite virulence in a single host, B. terrestris, could be resolved through understanding the parasite's virulence in this sympatric host species. Nosema bombi significantly impacted colony growth, individual longevity, and individual development in B. lucorum. However, these effects were different both qualitatively and quantitatively to the parasite's impact in B. terrestris. Infected colonies of B. lucorum successfully produced both male and female reproductives, and infected female reproductives were capable of successful mating. Variation in life-history across host species may explain differences in the virulence, or impact of the parasite in B. terrestris and B. lucorum, with species with shorter life-cycles being more likely to transfer the parasite from one annual generation to the next. These results suggest that to understand the virulence and epidemiology of multi-host parasites we need to examine their ecological interactions across their various host species.

AB The rate at which mutations occur in nature is itself under natural selection. While a general reduction of mutation rates is advantageous for species inhabiting constant environments, higher mutation rates can be advantageous for those inhabiting fluctuating environments that impose on-going directional selection. Analogously, species involved in antagonistic co-evolutionary arms races, such as hosts and parasites, can also benefit from higher mutation rates. We use modifier theory, combined with simulations, to investigate the evolution of mutation rate in such a host-parasite system. We derive an expression for the evolutionary stable mutation rate between two alleles, each of whose fitness depends on the current genetic composition of the other species. Recombination has been shown to weaken the strength of selection acting on mutation modifiers, and accordingly, we find that the evolutionarily attracting mutation rate is lower when recombination between the selected and the modifier locus is high. Cyclical dynamics are potentially commonplace for loci governing antagonistic species interactions. We characterize the parameter space where such cyclical dynamics occur and show that the evolution of large mutation rates tends to inhibit cycling and thus eliminates further selection on modifiers of the mutation rate. We then find using computer simulations that stochastic fluctuations in finite populations can increase the size of the region where cycles occur, creating selection for higher mutation rates. We finally use simulations to investigate the model behaviour when there are more than two alleles, finding that the region where cycling occurs becomes smaller and the evolutionarily attracting mutation rate lower when there are more alleles.

AB Markov chains have been frequently used in community ecology to model successional changes, but little attention has been paid to its application in population ecology as a tool to explore the outcomes of species interactions. Markov models can be regarded as "null models" that provide predicted values under a no-change scenario against which the consequences of changes in variables of interest can be assessed. Here we explore Markov chains' potential to project population trends of competing species and derive sensible management strategies. To do that we use six years of field data on territory occupancy and turn-over of two competing top predators in a Mediterranean landscape: the golden and Bonelli's eagles. The results suggest that long-term coexistence of both species in the study area is likely, with the main limitation for their coexistence being the difficulties Bonelli's eagles have in colonising new territories that become available. To avoid future declines in the population of Bonelli's eagle, it is important to take into account that the positive effects of conservation strategies focused on encouraging colonization (e.g. decreasing disperser mortality) are likely to be larger than those focused on avoiding territory abandonment (e.g. decreasing adult mortality). Markov chains are likely to be useful to evaluate the relative merit of alternative management options in other territorial species when patterns of territory occupancy are the only reliable data available, as often happens with large predators.

AB Matches between the bills of hummingbirds and the flowers they visit have been interpreted as examples of coadaptation and feeding specialization. Observations of birds feeding at flowers longer or shorter than their bills combined with a lack of experimental evidence for foraging trade-offs, however, fail to support these interpretations. We addressed these inconsistencies by considering a seldom-studied dimension of hummingbird-flower relationships, the shape of bills and flowers, through experiments on the Purple-throated Carib, Eulampis jugularis, and its major food plant, Heliconia, in the eastern Caribbean. Bills of male E. jugularis are considerably shorter and straighter than bills of females. We examined foraging performances and trade-offs during visits to natural heliconias and 34 artificial flowers of differing length and curvature. Supporting predictions based on matches between bill and flower morphology, handling times of females were significantly shorter than those of males at the long, curved flowers of a green morph of H. bihai. Contrary to predictions, handling times of males were not significantly shorter than handling times of females at the short flowers of H. caribaea. At artificial flowers, maximum extraction depths of females were significantly longer than maximum extraction depths of males at all curved flowers, but not at straight flowers. Handling times of females were significantly shorter than handling times of males at the longest artificial flowers for all curvatures, whereas handling times of males were significantly shorter at short, straight, artificial flowers, but only while hover-feeding without a perch. Within each sex, handling times were inversely related to bill length at long flowers for all shapes. Taken together, these performance trade-offs suggest that the long, curved bills of females are adapted for feeding from long, curved flowers, whereas the short bills of males are adapted for hover-feeding from short, straighter flowers. In addition, the finding that differences in feeding performance occur at the extremes of floral phenotypes suggests that the evolution of bill morphology may be driven by a small subset of the flowers visited by a hummingbird species.

AB Biotic interactions can affect the distribution of species across environmental gradients, and as air and soil temperatures increase, plant community response may depend on interactions with symbionts. We measured the effect of elevated soil temperatures on mycorrhizal function and on the response of both plant and fungal symbionts, using fungal inoculum isolated from either high-temperature thermal or nonthermal grassland soils. Our source for thermal soils was Yellowstone National Park, USA, where plants experience rooting zone temperatures of 45 degrees C or more. In the greenhouse, we grew three plant species (Dichanthelium lanuginosum, Agrostis scabra, and Mimulus guttatus) with three arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) treatments (no AMF, nonthermal AMF, thermal AMF) and two soil temperatures (ambient, elevated). Biomass of the facultative thermal plants Agrostis scabra and Mimulus guttatus decreased by 50% in elevated-temperature soils, and AMF had no effect on measured plant traits. In contrast, the biomass and total root length of the obligate thermal plant Dichanthelium lanuginosum were greater at elevated soil temperatures, but only when mycorrhizal. Both mycorrhizal colonization levels and length of extraradical hyphae (ERH) increased with soil temperature across all host species. The source of the AMF inoculum, on the other hand, did not affect colonization level, ERH length, host plant biomass, or flowering for all host species in either temperature treatment, suggesting that AMF from thermal soils are not specifically adapted to higher temperatures. In the field we collected soil cores to measure in situ depth distributions of D. lanuginosum roots and ERH, and to determine which AMF species were active in plants growing in thermal soils. Roots were limited to soils with an average temperature <= 30 degrees C, while ERH existed in the hottest soils we sampled, averaging 35 degrees C. Molecular analyses of roots indicated that thermal AMF communities were composed of both generalist and possibly unique fungal species. The increase in host plant allocation to AMF, apparent lack of temperature adaptation by AMF, and differential host response to AMF suggest that AMF could be significant drivers of plant community response to increased soil temperature associated with global change.

AB Theory predicts that the temporal stability of productivity, measured as the ratio of the mean to the standard deviation of community biomass, increases with species richness and evenness. We used experimental species mixtures of grassland plants to test this hypothesis and identified the mechanisms involved. Additionally, we tested whether biodiversity, productivity and temporal stability were similarly influenced by particular types of species interactions. We found that productivity was less variable among years in plots planted with more species. Temporal stability did not depend on whether the species were planted equally abundant (high evenness) or not (realistically low evenness). Greater richness increased temporal stability by increasing overyielding, asynchrony of species fluctuations and statistical averaging. Species interactions that favoured unproductive species increased both biodiversity and temporal stability. Species interactions that resulted in niche partitioning or facilitation increased both productivity and temporal stability. Thus, species interactions can promote biodiversity and ecosystem services.

AB The use of genomic techniques to address ecological questions is emerging as the field of genomic ecology. Experimentation under environmentally realistic conditions to investigate the molecular response of plants to meaningful changes in growth conditions and ecological interactions is the defining feature of genomic ecology. Because the impact of global change factors on plant performance are mediated by direct effects at the molecular, biochemical, and physiological scales, gene expression analysis promises important advances in understanding factors that have previously been consigned to the 'black box' of unknown mechanism. Various tools and approaches are available for assessing gene expression in model and nonmodel species as part of global change biology studies. Each approach has its own unique advantages and constraints. A first generation of genomic ecology studies in managed ecosystems and mesocosms have provided a testbed for the approach and have begun to reveal how the experimental design and data analysis of gene expression studies can be tailored for use in an ecological context.

ID SPRINGTAIL GOMPHIOCEPHALUS-HODGSONI; VICTORIA LAND; BIOTIC INTERACTIONS;

AB We tested whether the distribution of three common springtail species (Gressittacantha terranova, Gomphiocephalus hodgsoni and Friesea grisea) in Victoria Land (Antarctica) could be modelled as a function of latitude, longitude, altitude and distance from the sea.
   Victoria Land, Ross Dependency, Antarctica.
   Generalized linear models were constructed using species presence/absence data relative to geographical features (latitude, longitude, altitude, distance from sea) across the species' entire ranges. Model results were then integrated with the known phylogeography of each species and hypotheses were generated on the role of climate as a major driver of Antarctic springtail distribution.
   Based on model selection using Akaike's information criterion, the species' distributions were: hump-shaped relative to longitude and monotonic with altitude for Gressittacantha terranova; hump-shaped relative to latitude and monotonic with altitude for Gomphiocephalus hodgsoni; and hump-shaped relative to longitude and monotonic with latitude, altitude and distance from the sea for Friesea grisea.
   No single distributional pattern was shared by the three species. While distributions were partially a response to climatic spatial clines, the patterns observed strongly suggest that past geological events have influenced the observed distributions. Accordingly, present-day spatial patterns are likely to have arisen from the interaction of historical and environmental drivers. Future studies will need to integrate a range of spatial and temporal scales to further quantify their respective roles.

AB The generalization-specialization continuum exhibited in pollination interactions currently receives much attention. It is well-known that the pollinator assemblage of particular species varies temporally and spatially, and therefore the ecological generalization on pollinators may be a contextual attribute. However, the factors causing such variation and its ecological and evolutionary consequences are still poorly understood. This variation can be caused by spatial or temporal variation in the pollinator community, but also by variation in the plant community. Here, we examined how the floral neighbourhood influenced the generalization on pollinators and the composition of pollinators of six plant species differing in generalization levels and main pollinators. The diversity, identity and density of floral species affected both the level of generalization on pollinators and the composition of visitors of particular plant species. Although the relationships to floral neighbourhood varied considerably among species, generalization level and visitation by uncommon pollinators generally increased with floral diversity and richness. The generalization level of the neighbourhood was negatively related to the generalization level of the focal species in two species. The number of flowers of the pollinator-sharing species and the number of flowers of the focal species had different effects on the composition of visits in different species; attributable to differences in facilitation/competition for pollinator attraction. We propose that an important ecological implication of our results is that variation in species interactions caused by the pollination context may result in increased community stability. The main evolutionary implication of our results is that selection on flower and pollinator traits may depend, to an unknown extent, on the composition of the co-flowering plant community.

TI Dominant species can produce a negative relationship between species

AB Several studies have reported a positive relationship between species richness and ecosystem functioning. However, if much of a particular ecosystem function is performed by one species (i.e. a functionally dominant species) and this species is also a competitive dominant that excludes other taxa from a habitat, then it is possible to obtain a negative relationship between richness and ecosystem functioning. Results of a leaf pack breakdown experiment in a small stream suggested that the caddisfly Pycnopsyche gentilis, a common detritivorous insect in North American headwater streams, was both a functional and competitive dominant. In a second experiment we compared the effect of Pycnopsyche on leaf breakdown to that of other detritivore taxa by enclosing them with leaf packs in a section of headwater stream in which they were uncommon (Pycnopsyche transplant experiment). Final leaf pack mass was significantly lower in the Pycnopsyche enclosure treatment; leaves exposed to a greater diversity of detritivores displayed little reduction in leaf mass. These results demonstrated that Pycnopsyche was a functionally dominant detritivore. In a third experiment (Pycnopsyche density experiment) we found that Pycnopsyche was also a competitively dominant species. Leaf packs and large Pycnopsyche were placed in enclosures that were permeable to the majority of other detritivores but not Pycnopsyche. Leaf mass lost increased with increasing Pycnopsyche density. Leaf packs exposed to Pycnopsyche, however, contained fewer detritivore taxa which suggested that Pycnopsyche was also a competitive dominant. There was a negative relationship between three measures of diversity and leaf litter breakdown in the Pycnopsyche density experiment. Experiments conducted in natural communities that incorporate important species interactions may produce diversity-ecosystem function relationships other than the positive ones that are commonly reported.

AB Despite increasing interest in urban ecology most attention has focussed on describing changes in assemblage composition and structure along urbanisation gradients, whilst relatively little research has focussed on the mechanisms behind these changes. Ecological theory predicts that alterations in biotic interactions are particularly likely to arise, especially with regard to disease risk. Here, we report on differences in prevalence of avian malaria and tick infection and intensity in 11 paired urban and rural blackbird Turdus merula populations from across the western Palearctic. We find large and consistent reductions in tick prevalence and intensity in urban areas. There are also large reductions in the prevalence of avian malaria in many, but not all, urban areas. The proportion of first year birds in urban populations is significantly lower than that in rural ones, and across the more natural rural sites southerly populations contain fewer first years than northern ones. These patterns are expected to arise if survival rates are higher in urban areas, and are negatively correlated with latitude.

AB Recent die-off of coastal forests has been attributed primarily to the effects of sea level rise by correlation with tide-gage records. Due to the temporal and spatial scales involved, direct monitoring of sea level rise impacts is challenging and its attribution can be confounded by both land-use history and species interactions. Here we present experimental evidence for a micro-tidal, oligohaline estuarine system that the location of coastal treeline is determined by both environmental controls and positive and negative species interactions. We conducted field surveys and a transplant experiment to determine the controls on pine seedling establishment and survival along a salinity and flooding gradient. Using a two-way changepoint model we determined that sawgrass cover (Cladium jamaicense) and salinity concentrations interact to control natural pine regeneration (Pinus taeda). The long-term removal of sawgrass resulted in increased soil salinity and high rates of (planted) pine seedling mortality. In contrast, pine seedlings planted directly under sawgrass were able to survive at the same level as upland forest plots because of reduced salinity levels. This research provides evidence that sawgrass can facilitate pine seedling survival, but also suggests that either competitive exclusion by sawgrass or dispersal limitations prevent initial pine seedling regeneration. We propose that forest dynamics are closely coupled to fire, which consumes sawgrass biomass and reduces competition between pine seedlings and grass. Following fire, pine seedling establishment and the regrowth of sawgrass facilitates long-term pine seedling survival. Under this scenario, recent marsh invasion into coastal forests may not necessarily represent a permanent state change in locations where abiotic stress is not the only determinant for community composition.

AB A community is stable, and resilient, if the levels of all community variables can return to the original steady state following a perturbation. The stability properties of a community depend on its structure, which is the network of direct effects (interactions) among the variables within the community. These direct effects form feedback cycles (loops) that determine community stability. Although feedback cycles have an intuitive interpretation, identifying how they form the feedback properties of a particular community can be intractable. Furthermore, determining the role that any specific direct effect plays in the stability of a system is even more daunting. Such information, however, would identify important direct effects for targeted experimental and management manipulation even in complex communities for which quantitative information is lacking. We therefore provide a method that determines the sensitivity of community stability to model structure, and identifies the relative role of particular direct effects, indirect effects, and feedback cycles in determining stability. Structural sensitivities summarize the degree to which each direct effect contributes to stabilizing feedback or destabilizing feedback or both. Structural sensitivities prove useful in identifying ecologically important feedback cycles within the community structure and for detecting direct effects that have strong, or weak, influences on community stability. The approach may guide the development of management intervention and research design. We demonstrate its value with two theoretical models and two empirical examples of different levels of complexity. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Understanding the forms that the geographic range limits of species take, their causes and their consequences are key issues in ecology and evolutionary biology. They are also topics on which understanding is advancing rapidly. This themed issue of Proc. R. Soc. B focuses on the wide variety of current research perspectives on the nature and determinants of the limits to geographic ranges. The contributions address important themes, including the roles and influences of dispersal limitation, species interactions and physiological limitation, the broad patterns in the structure of geographic ranges, and the fundamental question of why at some point species no longer evolve the ability to overcome the factors constraining their distributions and thus fail to continue to spread. In this introduction, these contributions are placed in the wider context of these broad themes.

AB We link spatially explicit climate change predictions to a dynamic metapopulation model. Predictions of species' responses to climate change, incorporating metapopulation dynamics and elements of dispersal, allow us to explore the range margin dynamics for two lagomorphs of conservation concern. Although the lagomorphs have very different distribution patterns, shifts at the edge of the range were more pronounced than shifts in the overall metapopulation. For Romerolagus diazi (volcano rabbit), the lower elevation range limit shifted upslope by approximately 700 m. This reduced the area occupied by the metapopulation, as the mountain peak currently lacks suitable vegetation. For Lepus timidus (European mountain hare), we modelled the British metapopulation. Increasing the dispersive estimate caused the metapopulation to shift faster on the northern range margin (leading edge). By contrast, it caused the metapopulation to respond to climate change slower, rather than faster, on the southern range margin (trailing edge). The differential responses of the leading and trailing range margins and the relative sensitivity of range limits to climate change compared with that of the metapopulation centroid have important implications for where conservation monitoring should be targeted. Our study demonstrates the importance and possibility of moving from simple bioclimatic envelope models to second-generation models that incorporate both dynamic climate change and metapopulation dynamics.

AB Despite the importance of understanding the mechanisms underlying range limits and abundance structure, few studies have sought to do so. Here we use a terrestrial slug species, Deroceras panormitanum, that has invaded a remote, largely predator-free, Southern Ocean island as a model system to do so. Across Marion Island, slug density does not conform to an abundant centre distribution. Rather, abundance structure is characterized by patches and gaps. These are associated with this desiccation-sensitive species' preference for biotic and drainage line habitats that share few characteristics except for their high humidity below the vegetation surface. The coastal range margin has a threshold form, rapidly rising from zero to high density. Slugs do not occur where soil-exchangeable Na values are higher than 3000 mg kg(-1), and in laboratory experiments, survival is high below this value but negligible above it. Upper elevation range margins are a function of the inability of this species to survive temperatures below an absolute limit of -6.4 degrees C, which is regularly exceeded at 200 m altitude, above which slug density declines to zero. However, the linear decline in density from the coastal peak is probably also a function of a decline in performance or time available for activity. This is probably associated with an altitudinal decline in mean annual soil temperature. These findings support previous predictions made regarding the form of density change when substrate or climatic factors set range limits.

ID LANDSCAPE; ORGANISMS
AB All organisms alter their abiotic environment, but ecosystem engineers are species with abiotic effects that may have to be explicitly accounted for when making predictions about population and community dynamics. The goal of this analysis is to identify those conditions in which engineering leads to population dynamics that are qualitatively different than one would predict using models that incorporate only biotic interactions. We present a simple model coupling an ecosystem engineer and the abiotic environment. We assume that the engineer alters environmental conditions at a rate dependent on engineer density and that the environment decays back to original conditions at an exponential rate. We determine when the feedback to population dynamics through environmental state can lead to altered equilibrium densities, bistability, or runaway growth of the engineer population. The conditions leading to changes in dynamics, such as susceptibility of a system to engineering or alteration of density-dependent and density-independent controls, define cases in which the engineering concept is essential for ecological understanding.

   Delayed Ecological Recovery in Communities of Digital Organisms

AB A key issue concerning recovery from mass extinctions is how extinction and diversification mechanisms affect the recovery process. We evolved communities of digital organisms, subjecting them to instantaneous "pulse" extinctions, choosing survivors at random, or to prolonged "press" extinctions involving a period of low resource availability. Functional activity at low trophic levels recovered faster than at higher levels, with the most extensive delays seen at the top level. Postpress communities generally did not fully recover functional activity in the allotted time, which equaled that of their original diversification. We measured recovery of phenotypic diversity, observing considerable variation in outcomes. Communities subjected to pulse extinctions recovered functional activity and phenotypic diversity substantially faster than when subjected to press extinctions. Follow-up experiments tested whether organisms with shorter generation times and low functional activity contributed to delayed recovery after press extinctions. The results indicate that adaptation during the press episode degraded the organisms' ability to reevolve preextinction functionality. There are interesting parallels with patterns from the paleontological record. We suggest that some delayed recoveries from mass extinction may reflect the need to both reevolve biological functions and reconstruct ecological interactions lost during the extinction. Adaptation to conditions during an extended disturbance may hinder subsequent recovery.

AB Mammals that build extensive open burrow systems are often classified as ecosystem engineers, since they have the potential to modulate the availability of resources for themselves and other organisms. Lizards may benefit from the heterogeneity created by these structures, especially if coupled with an increased offer of sites for refuge and thermoregulation. However, information about these engineering effects by burrowing animals is scarce. We investigated the influence of European rabbit burrows on several parameters of a Mediterranean lizard community (abundance, density, diversity and body condition) in three different habitats (open pastures, holm oak and scrub patches). We found that lizards were positively associated with burrows, and that burrows determined lizard presence at otherwise unfavourable habitats. Moreover, community parameters such as density and species richness were higher in sites with burrows. Burrows influenced lizard species in different ways, and were also relevant for other Mediterranean vertebrates, as revealed by questionnaires to experts. We also explored the possible resources provided by burrows for lizards. Warrens offer relatively abundant prey and appropriate retreat sites for refuge and thermoregulation. Warrens may have further implications within the ecosystem, acting as stepping stones, allowing lizards to reach otherwise inaccessible habitat patches. This study shows that European rabbit warrens have a positive influence on lizard density and diversity, and confirms the role of rabbits as ecosystem engineers. This reinforces the need for appropriate conservation measures for rabbits, especially given their threatened status in the Iberian Peninsula. Furthermore, our study highlights that taking into account the influence of engineering activities increases our awareness of species interactions, and may translate into more adequate conservation measures for the preservation of biodiversity.

AB Results from experiments studying different factors determining invasibility (e.g. land use, disturbance, biotic interactions) at different spatial scales are mainly used in isolation, probably because a methodology for integration is lacking. Recent studies show that factors affecting invasibility most likely do so in a hierarchical manner, with different factors acting more strongly at different spatial scales. Climate can be considered the dominant factor at the continental scale, while at regional and landscape scale topography, land cover and land use become increasingly important. At smaller spatial scales, soil type, disturbance, biotic interactions, resources, and microclimate may become significant. In the current paper, we propose a hierarchical framework for combining results from different types of studies. In this hierarchical system, factors operating at a smaller scale are subordinate to factors operating at a larger scale, but if conditions at higher levels are satisfied, the small-scale factors may become indispensable for making accurate predictions. Depending on the aim of the study, the accuracy of prediction can be selected by the researcher, which in its turn determines which data are required. We discuss several applications of the framework and indicate some options for future research. Although the complexity of natural systems presents fundamental limits to predictions, we think this framework can provide a useful tool for the identification of areas of risk for biological invasions, for improving our understanding of invasibility, and for identifying gaps in our current knowledge.

AB In Florida, the Cuban Treefrog (Osteopilus septentrionalis) is a superb colonist and appears to be a significant driver of amphibian community dynamics. Decline of native anurans has been linked to possible competition with adult O. septentrionalis but interactions during the larval stage are largely unknown. Rearing O. septentrionalis tadpoles along with two native anurans, the Squirrel Treefrog (Hyla squirella) and the Southern Toad (Bufo terrestris) in both experimental artificial ponds and laboratory aquaria, the role of competition as the mechanism driving the dynamics of invaded amphibian communities in Florida was examined. Also examined was the role of priority effects and variation between pond locations in altering interactions between O. septentrionalis and native anuran larvae. Interspecific competition was strong during the larval stage; the presence of O. septentrionalis reduced larval performance and survival of native anurans. Pond location alone had little effect on interspecific interactions, but priority effects were strong. Pond location and priority effects acted together to influence species interactions. The selective influence of different interaction modifiers acted to increase or decrease the impacts of exotic species on native taxa.

AB Studying plant invasions along environmental gradients is a promising approach to dissect the relative importance of multiple interacting factors that affect the spread of a species in a new range. Along altitudinal gradients, factors such as propagule pressure, climatic conditions and biotic interactions change simultaneously across rather small geographic scales. Here we investigate the distribution of eight Asteraceae forbs along mountain roads in both their native and introduced ranges in the Valais (southern Swiss Alps) and the Wallowa Mountains (northeastern Oregon, USA). We hypothesised that a lack of adaptation and more limiting propagule pressure at higher altitudes in the new range restricts the altitudinal distribution of aliens relative to the native range. However, all but one of the species reached the same or even a higher altitude in the new range. Thus neither the need to adapt to changing climatic conditions nor lower propagule pressure at higher altitudes appears to have prevented the altitudinal spread of introduced populations. We found clear differences between regions in the relative occurrence of alien species in ruderal sites compared to roadsides, and in the degree of invasion away from the roadside, presumably reflecting differences in disturbance patterns between regions. Whilst the upper altitudinal limits of these plant invasions are apparently climatically constrained, factors such as anthropogenic disturbance and competition with native vegetation appear to have greater influence than changing climatic conditions on the distribution of these alien species along altitudinal gradients.

AB Evaluating habitat suitability is often complex, as habitat effects may be scale-dependent, critical resources may be spatially segregated, and resource availability may also depend on intra- and inter-specific interactions. Using analyses that spanned multiple years and spatial scales, we investigated habitat requirements of a territorial generalist, the common raven Corvus corax, in a relatively pristine woodland, Bialowieza Forest (E Poland). We compiled data from multiple raven surveys conducted between 1985 and 2001. Ravens were regularly distributed over the entire study area but declined in density over 50% within the 16 yr interval. In the same period game and forest management significantly reduced ungulate densities and likely diminished the habitat quality with regard to food supply, especially carrion. To better understand habitat requirements of ravens we studied breeding performance in relation to three different habitat types across multiple scales: open areas, coniferous-dominated forest, and deciduous-dominated forest. We found a prominent dissimilarity between raven nesting and foraging habitats highlighting the importance of resource complementation for ravens. On a fine scale, large old pines were exclusively selected as nesting trees and nesting areas were generally coniferous-dominated. However, at increasingly broader scales, coniferous habitats were negatively associated with raven reproductive success as those habitats likely provide a lower food supply. Only where the coniferous nesting areas at smaller scales were complemented with high percentages of deciduous forests and open areas at broader scales did the breeding performance increase. In addition to habitat composition, intra-specific interactions were important determinants of reproductive performance and very successful neighbors decreased reproductive performance of a focal pair. Most of previous studies have investigated resource complementation in terms of habitat edges or proximity of complementing resource patches. Our study demonstrates that the concept of landscape complementation also applies to gradients in landscape composition and emphasizes the importance of scales and intraspecific interactions in habitat analyses.

AB Increased awareness of spatiotemporal variation in species interactions has motivated the study of temporally-resolved food web dynamics at the landscape level. Empiricists have focused attention on cross-habitat flows of materials, nutrients, and prey, largely ignoring the movement of predators between habitats that differ in productivity (and how predators integrate pulses in resource availability over time). We set out to study seasonal variation in food web interactions between mammalian carnivores and their rodent prey along a riparian-upland gradient in semi-arid southeastern Arizona which features both spatial and temporal heterogeneity in resource availability. Specifically, we tested whether mammalian carnivores spill over from productive, near-river habitats into adjacent, desert-scrub habitats; and if they do, to document the effects of this spillover on rodent communities. Furthermore, we examined seasonal variation in top-down effects by measuring changes in carnivore diet and distribution patterns and rodent populations over time. The results indicate that carnivores track seasonally-abundant resources across the landscape, varying both their diet and movement patterns. In turn, desert-scrub rodent population dynamics track seasonal shifts in carnivore habitat use but not resource availability, suggesting that predation plays a role in structuring rodent communities along the San Pedro River. Further evidence comes from data on rodent community composition, which differs between desert-scrub habitats near and far from the river, despite similarities in resource availability. Our data also suggest that seasonal omnivory helps predators survive lean times, increasing their effects on prey populations. Taken together, these results underscore the importance of spatiotemporal variation in species interactions, highlighting the complexity of natural systems and the need for further detailed studies of food web dynamics.

AB Human-caused disruptions to seed-dispersal mutualisms increase the extinction risk for both plant and animal species. Large-seeded plants can be particularly vulnerable due to highly specialized dispersal systems and no compensatory regeneration mechanisms. Whitebark pine ( Pinus albicaulis), a keystone subalpine species, obligately depends upon the Clark's Nutcracker (Nucifraga columbiana) for dispersal of its large, wingless seeds. Clark's Nutcracker, a facultative mutualist with whitebark pine, is sensitive to rates of energy gain, and emigrates from subalpine forests during periods of cone shortages. The invasive fungal pathogen Cronartium ribicola, which causes white pine blister rust, reduces whitebark pine cone production by killing cone-bearing branches and trees. Mortality from blister rust reaches 90% or higher in some whitebark pine forests in the Northern Rocky Mountains, USA, and the rust now occurs nearly rangewide in whitebark pine. Our objectives were to identify the minimum level of cone production necessary to elicit seed dispersal by nutcrackers and to determine how cone production is influenced by forest structure and health. We quantified forest conditions and ecological interactions between nutcrackers and whitebark pine in three Rocky Mountain ecosystems that differ in levels of rust infection and mortality. Both the frequency of nutcracker occurrence and probability of seed dispersal were strongly related to annual whitebark pine cone production, which had a positive linear association with live whitebark pine basal area, and negative linear association with whitebark pine tree mortality and rust infection. From our data, we estimated that a threshold level of similar to 1000 cones/ha is needed for a high likelihood of seed dispersal by nutcrackers ( probability >= 0.7), and that this level of cone production can be met by forests with live whitebark pine basal area >5.0 m(2)/ha. The risk of mutualism disruption is greatest in northernmost Montana ( USA), where three-year mean cone production and live basal area fell below predicted threshold levels. There, nutcracker occurrence, seed dispersal, and whitebark pine regeneration were the lowest of the three ecosystems. Managers can use these threshold values to differentiate between restoration sites requiring planting of rust-resistant seedlings and sites where nutcracker seed dispersal can be expected.

AB Predators influence prey populations both by consuming individual prey, and by inducing changes in prey behaviour that limit reproduction and survival. Because prey trade-off predation risk for forageing gains, the magnitude of predators' non-consumptive effects should depend on resource availability. Studies of non-consumptive effects generally adopt either of two strategies: (i) maintaining a static ration of the prey's resources; and (ii) using resource populations that vary dynamically in response to prey behaviour. Contrasting these experimental designs using meta-analysis, we evaluated whether resource dynamics influence the magnitude of non-consumptive effects on prey growth, survival, fecundity, population density, forageing rate and habitat use. Predators had a more negative effect on prey demography in dynamic-vs. static-resource experiments. Our results highlight the importance of resource dynamics in mediating the magnitude of non-consumptive effects of predators on prey, and illustrate the often-unintended impacts of experimental design on estimates of effect size in ecological interactions.

AB 1. Local adaptation is a major factor shaping a species' range. Studies on adaptation to local abiotic conditions are numerous, but adaptation to neighbour conditions has been almost neglected, and these two have rarely been separated experimentally. We hypothesized that adaptation to abiotic stress (e.g. fast development, drought resistance) dominates at the stressful end of the gradient, while adaptation to competition ( e. g. large plant size) is more common at the benign end of the distribution range.
   2. We conducted a reciprocal sowing experiment coupled with a removal experiment in the field for two winter annual grass species Bromus fasciculatus C. Presl. and Brachypodium distachyon (L.) Beauv. from Mediterranean and arid populations in Jordan. The two species were also grown under standard conditions for evaluating whether traits indicative of competitive ability and tolerance to stress are more common for either of the ecotypes.
   3. Adaptation to abiotic stress could not be tested because our experiment was performed in a favourable year where water was not limiting in either of the sites. Competition was intense in both sites for the two populations of each species but competitive exclusion was observed only in the Mediterranean site. Mediterranean populations produced consistently more biomass and exhibited later onset of flowering than arid populations, both in the field and under standard conditions.
   4. Mediterranean populations also showed better competitive response ability however stress tolerance was no different to that of arid populations.
   5. This study indicates that competition and length of the growing season are major selective constraints at the two extremes of the ecological range along aridity gradients. We suggest that drought stress increases in importance during dry years and studies on local adaptation along climatic gradients may help predict the effect of global change on future species' distributions.

AB Early emergence of plant seedlings can offer strong competitive advantages over later-germinating neighbors through the preemption of limiting resources. This phenomenon may have contributed to the persistent dominance of European annual grasses over native perennial grasses in California grasslands, since the former species typically germinate earlier in the growing season than the latter and grow rapidly after establishing. Recently, European perennial grasses have been spreading into both non-native annual and native perennial coastal grass stands in California. These exotic perennials appear to be less affected by the priority effects arising from earlier germination by European annual grasses. In addition, these species interactions in California grasslands may be mediated by increasing anthropogenic or natural soil nitrogen inputs. We conducted a greenhouse experiment to test the effects of order of emergence and annual grass seedling density on native and exotic perennial grass seedling performance across different levels of nitrogen availability. We manipulated the order of emergence and density of an exotic annual grass (Bromus diandrus) grown with either Nassella pulchra (native perennial grass), Festuca rubra (native perennial grass), or Holcus lanatus (exotic perennial grass), with and without added nitrogen. Earlier B. diandrus emergence and higher B. diandrus density resulted in greater reduction in the aboveground productivity of the perennial grasses. However, B. diandrus suppressed both native perennials to a greater extent than it did H. lanatus. Nitrogen addition had no effect on the productivity of native perennials, but greatly increased the growth of the exotic perennial H. lanatus, grown with B. diandrus. These results suggest that the order of emergence of exotic annual versus native perennial grass seedlings could play an important role in the continued dominance of exotic annual grasses in California. The expansion of the exotic perennial grass H. lanatus in coastal California may be linked to its higher tolerance of earlier-emerging annual grasses and its ability to access soil resources amidst high densities of annual grasses.

AB The persistence of species in reserves depends in large part on the persistence of functional ecological interactions. Despite their importance, however, ecological interactions have not yet been explicitly incorporated into conservation prioritization methods. We develop here a general method for incorporating consumer-resource interactions into spatial reserve design. This method protects spatial consumer-resource interactions by protecting areas that maintain the connectivity between the distribution of consumers and resources. We illustrate our method with a conservation planning case study of a mammalian predator, American marten (Martes americana), and its two primary prey species, Red-backed vole (Clethrionomys rutilus) and Deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus). The conservation goal was to identify a reserve for marten that comprised 12% of a forest management unit in the boreal forest in Quebec, Canada. We compared reserves developed using analysis variants that utilized different levels of information about predator and prey habitat distributions, species-specific connectivity requirements, and interaction connectivity requirements. The inclusion of consumer-resource interactions in reserve-selection resulted in spatially aggregated reserves that maintained local habitat quality for the species. This spatial aggregation was not induced by applying a qualitative penalty for the boundary length of the reserve, but rather was a direct consequence of modelling the spatial needs of the interacting consumer and resources. Our method for maintaining connectivity between consumers and their resources within reserves can be applied even under the most extreme cases of either complete spatial overlap or complete spatial segregation of consumer-resource distributions. The method has been made available via public software. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Atmospheric CO2 enrichment may impact arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM) development and function, which could have subsequent effects on host plant species interactions by differentially affecting plant nutrient acquisition. However, direct evidence illustrating this scenario is limited. We examined how elevated CO2 affects plant growth and whether mycorrhizae mediate interactions between C-4 barnyard grass (Echinochloa crusgalli (L.) Beauv.) and C-3 upland rice (Oryza sativa L.) in a low nutrient soil. The monocultures and combinations with or without mycorrhizal inoculation were grown at ambient (400 +/- 20 mu mol mol (1)) and elevated CO2 (700 +/- 20 mu mol mol (1)) levels. The N-15 isotope tracer was introduced to quantify the mycorrhizally mediated N acquisition of plants. Elevated CO2 stimulated the growth of C-3 upland rice but not that Of C-4 barnyard grass under monoculture. Elevated CO2 also increased mycorrhizal colonization Of C-4 barnyard grass but did not affect mycorrhizal colonization Of C-3 upland rice. Mycorrhizal inoculation increased the shoot biomass ratio of C-4 barnyard grass to C-3 upland rice under both CO2 concentrations but had a greater impact under the elevated than ambient CO2, level. Mycorrhizae decreased relative interaction index (RII) of C-3 plants under both ambient and elevated CO2, but mycorrhizae increased RII Of C-4 plants only under elevated CO2. Elevated CO2 and mycorrhizal inoculation enhanced N-15 and total N and P Uptake Of C-4 barnyard grass in mixture but had no effects on N and P acquisition of C-3 upland rice, thus altering the distribution of N and P between the species in mixture. These results implied that CO2 stimulation of mycorrhizae and their nutrient acquisition may impact competitive interaction Of C-4 barnyard grass and C-3 upland rice under future CO2, scenarios.

AB The coldwater crayfish Orconectes eupunctus is endemic to the Spring and Eleven Point Rivers of Arkansas and Missouri, and appears to have been displaced from a portion of its range by the recently introduced ringed crayfish Orconectes neglectus. We examined competition among juveniles as a potential mechanism for this crayfish species displacement through laboratory and field experiments. Orconectes eupunctus juveniles survived and grew in stream cages in their former range, implicating biotic interactions rather than habitat degradation in the displacement. Laboratory experiments revealed O. neglectus juveniles were dominant in the presence of limited food, whereas size rather than species determined occupancy of limited shelter. In a field competition experiment using stream cages, O. neglectus juveniles did not inhibit growth or reduce survival of O. eupunctus juveniles. Consequently, laboratory evidence of O. neglectus dominance did not correspond with competition under field conditions. Combined with previous studies examining the effects of O. neglectus on O. eupunctus, these results suggest that competition may not be a factor in this crayfish species displacement. Alternate mechanisms for the apparent displacement of O. eupunctus by O. neglectus, such as differential predation or reproductive interference, should be investigated.

AB Many plants interact with groups of mutualist pollinators and seed dispersers. A key issue for both basic ecology and conservation is whether the different species within these guilds of mutualist animals are functionally equivalent. Comparing the relative effects of sympatric mutualists is important for understanding the evolution of multispecies mutualisms and for predicting mutualism stability in the face of anthropogenic change. However, empirical comparisons of the population-level impacts of mutualist animals on their host plant are rare, particularly for seed dispersal mutualisms in species-rich ecosystems. We compared the influence of three seed-dispersing tropical mammals, lar gibbons ( Hylobates lar), sambar deer (Rusa unicolor), and red muntjac deer ( Muntiacus muntjak), on the demography of a shared host tree in Thailand, Choerospondias axillaris ( Anacardiaceae). Sambar and muntjac dispersed far more C. axillaris seeds than did gibbons. While sambar deposited many seeds under female tree canopies, muntjac were the only disperser to move seeds to open microhabitats, where C. axillaris seed germination, seedling survival, and initial growth are enhanced. Using stage-based population models, we assessed how disperser-specific seed dispersal, variation in the frequency of canopy gap formation, and their interaction influenced the potential population growth of C. axillaris. Large differences in dispersal quantity and small differences in dispersal quality among sambar and gibbons resulted in similar and negligible impacts on the tree's population dynamics. Muntjac, by taking some of the seeds to open microhabitats, are projected to have a greater positive impact on C. axillaris demography than either sambar or gibbons. Model comparisons of population-level species impacts may allow us to predict which ecological interactions are at risk from loss of critical species.

AB The "fundamental niche'' is the range of conditions under which an organism can survive and reproduce, measured in the absence of biotic interactions. Niche measurements are often based on statistical relationships between species presence and measured environmental variables, or inferred from measured responses of species along hypothesized niche axes. In this study, we use novel, process-based models of how irradiance and gas diffusion influence photosynthesis and respiration to predict niche dimensions for three coral species: Acropora nasuta, Montipora foliosa, and Leptoria phrygia. We use a combination of mathematical modeling, laboratory experiments, and field observations to establish the link between energy acquisition and the dominant environmental gradients on reefs: light intensity and water flow velocity. Our approach allows us to quantify how the shape of the niche varies in response to light and flow conditions. The model predicts that, due to its higher photosynthetic capacity, the branching coral A. nasuta has a positive energy balance over a wider range of conditions than both a massive species ( L. phrygia) and a foliose species ( M. foliosa). Moreover, colony size influences niche width, with larger colonies of all three species achieving a positive energy balance over a broader range of conditions than small colonies. Comparison of model predictions with field data demonstrated that tissue biomass and reproductive output are significantly and positively correlated with predicted energy acquisition. These results show how interactions between light and flow determine organism performance along environmental gradients on coral reefs. In addition, this study demonstrates the utility of process-based models for quantifying how physiology influences ecology, and for predicting the ecological consequences of varying environmental conditions.

AB While many studies have demonstrated that organic farms support greater levels of biodiversity, it is not known whether this translates into better provision of ecosystem services. Here we use a food-web approach to analyse the community structure and function at the whole-farm scale. Quantitative food webs from 10 replicate pairs of organic and conventional farms showed that organic farms have significantly more species at three trophic levels (plant, herbivore and parasitoid) and significantly different network structure. Herbivores on organic farms were attacked by more parasitoid species on organic farms than on conventional farms. However, differences in network structure did not translate into differences in robustness to simulated species loss and we found no difference in percentage parasitism (natural pest control) across a variety of host species. Furthermore, a manipulative field experiment demonstrated that the higher species richness of parasitoids on the organic farms did not increase mortality of a novel herbivore used to bioassay ecosystem service. The explanation for these differences is likely to include inherent differences in management strategies and landscape structure between the two farming systems.

AB 1. In some situations fish have strong top-down effects in stream communities while in others they seem to be relatively unimportant. Differences in the impact of fish may depend on a variety of factors including the foraging mode of the fish, interactions among fish species and temporal variation in environmental conditions and species interactions.
   2. We investigated the effect of brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and mottled sculpin (Cottus bairdi) on lower trophic levels in Appalachian streams and whether or not interactions between these fish changed their influence. Mesocosms were placed in a headwater stream in a randomized complete block design. Within blocks, mesocosms were randomly assigned to one of the following treatments: (i) no fish; (ii) sculpin only; (iii) trout only and (iv) both sculpin and trout. Fish biomass was the same in all three fish treatments. Invertebrate density and algal biomass in mesocosms were determined after 3 weeks. We repeated the experiment in the autumn, spring and summer to test for seasonality of fish effects.
   3. The effect of fish on invertebrate assemblages was seasonal and depended on prey identity. Sculpin strongly suppressed grazer abundance in spring while trout had little effect on grazers in any season. The influence of both fish on insect predators was similar and relatively constant across seasons. We found little evidence of an interaction between sculpin and trout that strongly influenced their effect on prey across seasons.
   4. None of the fish treatments influenced algal biomass during any of the seasons. Algal growth was also seasonal, with a two- to four-fold increase in algal biomass in spring compared to autumn and summer.
   5. Our results indicate that benthic and drift feeding fish differ in their effects on some, but not all prey. Furthermore, fish effects on prey were strongly seasonal for some, but not all prey types. While the temporal context is not commonly considered, our results indicate seasonality can be an important component of predator-prey interactions in streams.

AB 1. Co-existing plants and flower-visiting animals often form complex interaction networks. A long-standing question in ecology and evolutionary biology is how to detect nonrandom subsets (compartments, blocks, modules) of strongly interacting species within such networks. Here we use a network analytical approach to (i) detect modularity in pollination networks, (ii) investigate species composition of modules, and (iii) assess the stability of modules across sites.
   2. Interactions between entomophilous plants and their flower-visitors were recorded throughout the flowering season at three heathland sites in Denmark, separated by >= 10 km. Among sites, plant communities were similar, but composition of flower-visiting insect faunas differed. Visitation frequencies of visitor species were recorded as a measure of insect abundance. 3.
   Qualitative (presence-absence) interaction networks were tested for modularity. Modules were identified, and species classified into topological roles (peripherals, connectors, or hubs) using 'functional cartography by simulated annealing', a method recently developed by Guimera & Amaral (2005a).
   4. All networks were significantly modular. Each module consisted of 1-6 plant species and 18-54 insect species. Interactions aggregated around one or two hub plant species, which were largely identical at the three study sites.
   5. Insect species were categorized in taxonomic groups, mostly at the level of orders. When weighted by visitation frequency, each module was dominated by one or few insect groups. This pattern was consistent across sites.
   6. Our study adds support to the conclusion that certain plant species and flower-visitor groups are nonrandomly and repeatedly associated. Within a network, these strongly interacting subgroups of species may exert reciprocal selection pressures on each other. Thus, modules may be candidates for the long-sought key units of co-evolution.

AB 1. The stress-gradient hypothesis (SGH) predicts that the frequency of facilitative and competitive interactions will vary inversely across abiotic stress gradients, with facilitation being more common in conditions of high abiotic stress relative to more benign abiotic conditions. With notable exceptions, most tests of the SGH have studied the interaction between a single pair or a few pairs of species, and thus have evaluated shifts in the magnitude and direction of pair-wise interactions along stress gradients, rather than shifts in the general frequency of interactions.
   2. The SGH has been supported by numerous studies in many ecosystems, has provided a crucial foundation for studying the interplay between facilitation and competition in plant communities, and has a high heuristic value. However, recent empirical research indicates that factors like the variation among species and the nature of the stress gradient studied add complexity not considered in the SGH, creating an opportunity to extend the SGH's general conceptual framework.
   3. We suggest that one approach for extending the SGH framework is to differentiate between the original idea of how 'common' interactions might be along stress gradients and the ubiquitous empirical approach of studying shifts in the strength of pair-wise interactions. Furthermore, by explicitly considering the life history of the interacting species (relative tolerance to stress vs. competitive ability) and the characteristics of the stress factor (resource vs. non-resource) we may be able to greatly refine specific predictions relevant to the SGH.
   4. We propose that the general pattern predicted by the SGH would hold more frequently for some combinations of life histories and stress factor, particularly when the benefactor and beneficiary species are mostly competitive and stress-tolerant, respectively. However, we also predict that other combinations are likely to yield different results. For example, the effect of neighbours can be negative at both ends of the stress gradient when both interacting species have similar 'competitive' or 'stress-tolerant' life histories and the abiotic stress gradient is driven by a resource (e. g. water).
   5. Synthesis. The extension of the SGH presented here provides specific and testable hypotheses to foster research and helps to reconcile potential discrepancies among previous studies. It represents an important step in incorporating the complexity and species-specificity of potential outcomes into models and theories addressing how plant-plant interactions change along stress gradients.

AB 1. Rank reversals in species performance are theoretically important for structuring communities, maintaining diversity and determining the course of forest succession. Species growth ranks can change with ontogeny or in different microenvironments, but interactions between ontogeny and the environment are not well-understood because of the lack of long-term forest competition studies. While early differences in growth among species may reflect intrinsic differences in shade-tolerance and physiology, ontogenetic trends in growth and variation in neighbourhood density and composition may change or even reverse early patterns of growth rankings.
   2. We experimentally studied spatial and temporal patterns of species interactions and growth for three northern tree species: Larix laricina, Picea mariana and Pinus strobus. We compared species size and growth rankings over an 11-year period, for different species mixtures planted at four density levels in north-eastern Minnesota, USA.
   3. The benefits of different growth strategies changed with ontogeny and density leading to reversals in the size rank of competing species over time and space. High-density stands promoted dominance and resource pre-emption by L. laricina, whereas lower-density stands favoured gradual accumulation of biomass and eventual dominance by P. strobus. In the absence of strong neighbour competition, ontogenetic trends in growth had greater influence on growth patterns.
   4. Species interactions affected the productivity of mixed stands vs. monocultures. Species generally grew more in monoculture than when planted with P. strobus at low density, or with L. laricina at high density. Only L. laricina and P. mariana showed potential for greater overall productivity, or over-yielding, when planted together than alone, probably because of improved resource uptake by the highly stratified canopy.
   5. Synthesis. Density predictably determined whether size-asymmetric growth or ontogenetic growth trends would drive early establishment and growth patterns. Variation in vertical and horizontal structure that results from early competitive dynamics can influence the successional trajectory or character of the mature forest. This study extends previous efforts to identify the causes of rank reversals in communities and understand the importance of temporal changes beyond the early years of seedling establishment.

AB 1. Understanding the factors that influence habitat persistence is a central theme in ecology, particularly for habitats created by terrestrial and aquatic primary producers that are some of the world's most extensive and ecologically important.
   2. Many species have positive (e. g. farming) or negative effects (e. g. herbivory) on the abundance of primary producers, potentially causing wholesale switches in habitat structure if the net outcome of effects moves toward one extreme (e. g. over-grazing). Predicting the conditions under which such switches occur remains a key challenge for ecologists.
   3. The purpose of this study was to understand how co-habiting species of opposing effect (damselfish as habitat facilitators vs. sea urchins as habitat consumers) can directly and indirectly influence the persistence of algal habitats on a tropical coast, including their potential to initiate switches among habitat types (productive 'turfs' of filamentous algae vs. 'barrens' of encrusting algae).
   4. Using a series of five independent experiments, we observed that damselfish facilitated the production of algal turfs both directly, through active farming of selected species, and indirectly, by vigorously attacking and expelling invading urchins from the local area (i.e. preventing herbivory). In contrast, urchins consumed algal turf to directly maintain barrens.
   5. The negative effects of urchins on algal turf were strong enough to initiate a habitat switch from turf to barrens, but this was conditional upon the absence of damselfish and the presence of a particular species of urchin.
   6. Synthesis. These results build upon our understanding of the dynamics of habitat persistence by demonstrating the conditions where biological interactions of opposing direction (positive vs. negative) maintain or switch habitat types. Such knowledge is central to addressing global concerns about habitat loss and predicting the occurrence of switches to less-productive states.

AB The role of disturbance in community ecology has been studied extensively and is thought to free resources and reset successional sequences at the local scale and create heterogeneity at the regional scale. Most studies have investigated effects on either the disturbed patch or on the entire community. but have generally ignored any effect of or on the community surrounding disturbed patches. We used marine fouling communities to examine the effect of a surrounding community on species abundance within a disturbed patch and the effect of a disturbance on species abundance in the surrounding community. We varied both the magnitude and pattern of disturbance on experimental settlement plates. Settlement plates were dominated by a non-native bryozoan, which may have established because of the large amount of initial space available on plates. Percent covers of species within the patch were affected by the surrounding community. confirming previous studies' predictions about edge effects from the surrounding community on dynamics within a patch. Disturbance resulted in lower percent cover in the surrounding community, but there were no differences between magnitudes or spatial patterns of disturbance. Disturbance lowered population growth rates in the surrounding community, possibly by altering the abiotic environment or species interactions. Following disturbance, the recovery of species within a patch may be affected by species in the surrounding community, but the effects of a disturbance can extend beyond the patch and after abundances in the surrounding community. The dependence of patch dynamics on the surrounding community and the extended effects of disturbance on the surrounding community, suggest an important feedback of disturbance on patch dynamics indirectly via the surrounding community.

AB Bacterial endosymbionts are common in insects and can have dramatic effects on their host's evolution. So far, the only heritable symbionts found in Drosophila have been Wolbachia and Spiroplasma. While the incidence and effects of Wolbachia have been studied extensively, the prevalence and significance of Spiroplasma infections in Drosophila are less clear. These small, gram-positive, helical bacteria infect a diverse array of plant and arthropod hosts, conferring a variety of fitness effects. Male-killing Spiroplasma are known from certain Drosophila species; however, in others, Spiroplasma appear not to affect sex ratio. Previous studies have identified different Spiroplasma haplotypes in Drosophila populations, although no extensive surveys have yet been reported. We used a multilocus sequence analysis to reconstruct a robust Spiroplasma endosymbiont phylogeny, assess genetic diversity, and look for evidence of recombination. Six loci were sequenced from over 65 Spiroplasma-infected individuals from nine different Drosophila species. Analysis of these sequences reveals at least five separate introductions of four phylogenetically distinct Spiroplasma haplotypes, indicating that more extensive sampling will likely reveal an even greater Spiroplasma endosymbiont diversity. Patterns of variation in Drosophila mitochondrial haplotypes in Spiroplasma-infected and uninfected flies imply imperfect vertical transmission in host populations and possible horizontal transmission.

AB Regime shift inducibility depends on equilibrium resilience, which depends on species interactions. When species interactions include intraguild predation (IGP), integrated pest management may induce regime shifts because enhancing the abundance of intraguild predators simultaneously increases competition with, and predation on, invasive prey. To explore the dynamical consequences of such manipulations, we use a bistable, deterministic IGP model with stochastic removals that perturb invader density from the high-density equilibrium. We quantify the combined effects of IGP and such perturbations in terms of mean first passage times (MFPTs) to target invader densities such as thresholds between regimes. Analytical MFPTs compare favorably with those generated by Monte Carlo numerical solutions of the stochastically perturbed IGP model. MFPTs can therefore usefully quantify equilibrium resilience in terms of perturbation schedules.

AB Tropical weather disturbances are a major influence on coastal wetlands in North America. However, studies of their impact on biotic communities are rare. The abundance and species composition of amphibians and reptiles were investigated within levee, herbaceous marsh, and forested swamp habitats in southeastern Louisiana from 2002 to 2004 and again in 2005 to 2006. During the course of this study, their major hurricanes (Ivan, Katrina, and Rita) affected our study sites. This allowed us to opportunistically document the effect of major storm disturbances by comparing species richness. diversity, community assemblage, and abundance of amphibians and reptiles before and after hurricane events. We also used a previous study conducted in the same area during the late 1980's to assess long-term community composition changes. We documented the highest species richness in the forested swamp habitat (23 species), but the most diverse assemblage was found in marsh habitat (H' = 2.082). Overall, herpetofaunal diversity decreased and evenness increased in each habitat following hurricanes Ivan and Katrina/Rita. Drastic decreases in overall abundance of amphibians occurred. while the effect on reptile abundance varied with habitat. Reduced abundance of reptiles in marsh was recorded over the course of the study, while abundances in adjacent levee hibitat increased suggesting displacement of certain reptiles from the marsh to the levee. Significant saltwater intrusion was recorded in marsh and levee habitats. but not in the forested swamp. The hurricanes altered community composition and increased species evenness within each habitat, potentially affecting long-term community dynamics and species interactions.

In this study, we investigate the potential threat that the European green crab, Carcinus maenas, represents to sub-adult lobsters, Homarus americanus, in Passamaquoddy Bay, Canada, northwest Atlantic. We conducted transect surveys using SCUBA diving to evaluate spatial overlap between these species inside, and immediately adjacent to, a lobster nursery area, and ran two laboratory experiments to investigate interactions between them in conditions of limited food and shelter availability. We found marked spatial overlap between these species in nature, particularly between adult green crabs and sub-adult lobsters in the shallower parts of the nursery area. It was not uncommon to see green crabs and sub-adult lobsters less than 1-2 m from one another, and we estimated mean nearest-neighbor values as low as 0.5-1 m on certain transects and months, with a grand mean of 5.17 +/- 1.62 m (SE). Monte Carlo randomization of positional data revealed that green crabs and lobsters were randomly distributed relative to one another; individuals of one species did not seem to aggregate or segregate relative to individuals of the other species. In the lab, green crabs did not negatively affect survival (one exception), growth, activity, feeding, or shelter use of sub-adult lobsters. In fact, sub-adult lobsters regularly preyed upon green crabs in the first lab experiment, where heterospecific individuals were matched for body mass. Our results suggest that green crabs do not pose a significant threat to sub-adult lobsters in Passamaquoddy Bay, and may in fact represent a food subsidy for them. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB The well-known fig-fig wasp and yucca-yucca moth mutualisms are classic examples of obligate mutualisms that have been shaped by millions of years of coevolution. Pollination systems involving obligate seed parasites are only expected to evolve under rare circumstances where their positive effects are not swamped by abundant co-pollinators and heavy costs resulting from seed destruction. Here, we show that, in Phyllantheae, specialization to pollination by Epicephala moths evolved at least five times, involving more than 500 Phyllantheae species in this obligate association. Active pollination behaviour evolved once in Epicephala, 10-20 Myr after the initial divergence of their host plants. The pollinating Epicephala moths thus radiated on an already-diverged host lineage and successively colonized new Phyllantheae hosts, thereby giving rise to repeated independent evolution of the specialized pollination system in Phyllantheae. The present evolutionary success of this association rests entirely upon active pollination by Epicephala, making this a distinct example of an evolutionary key innovation. Overall, our findings provide a clear empirical demonstration of how a combination of evolutionary innovation and partner shifts facilitates the spread of mutualism in a coevolving species interaction.

AB Studies investigating the consequences of future climate changes on species distributions usually start with the assumption that species respond to climate changes in an individualistic fashion. This assumption has led researchers to use bioclimate envelope models that use present climate-range relationships to characterize species' limits of tolerance to climate, and then apply climate-change scenarios to enable projections of altered species distributions. However, there are techniques that combine climate variables together with information on the composition of assemblages to enable projections that are expected to mimic community dynamics. Here, we compare, for the first time, the performance of GLM (generalized linear model) and CQO (canonical quadratic ordination; a type of community-based GLM) for projecting distributions of species under climate change scenarios. We found that projections from these two methods varied both in terms of accuracy (GLM providing generally more accurate projections than CQO) and in the broad diversity patterns yielded (higher species richness values projected with CQO). Model outputs were also affected by species-specific traits, such as species range size and species geographical positions, supporting the view that methods are sensitive to different degrees of equilibrium of species distributions with climate. This study reveals differences in projections between individual- and community-based approaches that require further scrutiny, but it does not find support for unsupervised use community-based models for investigating climate change impacts on species distributions. Reasons for this lack of support are discussed.

AB Temperature has strong, predictable effects on metabolism. Through this mechanism, environmental temperature affects individuals and populations of poikilotherms by determining rates of resource use, growth, reproduction, and mortality. Predictable variation in metabolic processes such as growth and reproduction could affect the strength of species interactions, but the community-level consequences of metabolic temperature dependence are virtually unexplored. I experimentally tested the hypothesis that plant herbivore interaction strength increases with temperature using a common species of marine macroalga (Sargassum filipendula) and the grazing amphipod Ampithoe longimana. Increasing temperature increased per capita interaction strength in two independent experiments and reversed a positive effect of temperature on plant growth. Temperature did not alter palatability of plant tissue to herbivores or average herbivore feeding rate. A predictable effect of temperature on herbivore-plant interaction strength could provide key information toward understanding local food web responses to changing temperatures at different spatial and temporal scales. Efforts to extend the effects of physiological mechanisms to larger scale patterns, including projections of the ecological effects of climate change, must be expanded to include the effects of changing conditions on trophic interactions.

AB While density dependence is a popular topic of research in population ecology, it has received much less attention at the community level. Using 27 years of data from Heron Island, on Australia's Great Barrier Reef, we develop a matrix model of coral community dynamics that shows that community-level density dependence does occur and that it is fairly common, being found in 38% of the model parameters for which it was tested. In particular, colonization of free space (through either recruitment or growth of existing colonies) was nearly always density dependent. There were no consistent patterns in the results for mortality, persistence, or species interactions. Most transitions were found to be dependent on the cover of the incoming species group, with only a few dependent on that of the outgoing species group. In addition, few of the transitions representing species interactions were dependent on the amount of free space present, suggesting that the cover of other species does not influence encounters.
   When these results were combined into a model of community dynamics, it was found that density dependence resulted in a moderate increase in coral cover, which was spread over most species groups. The dynamics of the density-dependent assemblage were also a lot noisier than those of an assemblage without density dependence. Sensitivity analysis indicated that it was density dependence in the colonization probabilities, particularly of encrusting acroporids, bushy Acropora and staghorn Acropora, which had the main influence on the model, although persistence of free space was also important. Transitions representing mortality were only of minor importance, and those representing species interactions were of no importance.

AB Epidemiologists increasingly realize that species interactions (e.g. selective predation) can determine when epidemics start and end. We hypothesize here that resource quality can also strongly influence disease dynamics: epidemics can be inhibited when resource quality for hosts is too poor and too good. In three lakes, resource quality for the zooplankton host (Daphnia dentifera) was poor when fungal epidemics (Metschnikowia bicuspidata) commenced and increased as epidemics waned. Experiments using variation in algal food showed that resource quality had conflicting effects on underlying epidemiology: high-quality food induced large production of infective propagules (spores) and high birth rate but also reduced transmission. A model then illustrated how these underlying correlations can inhibit the start of epidemics (when spore production/birth rate are too low) but also catalyse their end (when transmission becomes too low). This resource quality mechanism is likely to interface with other ones controlling disease dynamics and warrants closer evaluation.

AB Ecosystem-level nutrient dynamics during decomposition are often estimated from litter monocultures. If species effects are additive, we can statistically predict nutrient dynamics in multispecies systems from monoculture work, and potential consequences of species loss. However, if species effects are dependent on interactions with other litter species (that is, non-additive), predictions based on monoculture data will likely be inaccurate. We conducted a 3-year, full-factorial, mixed-litter decomposition study of four dominant tree species in a temperate forest and measured nitrogen and phosphorus dynamics to explore whether nutrient dynamics in mixtures were additive or non-additive. Following common approaches, we used litterfall data to predict nutrient dynamics at the ecosystem-level. In mixtures, we observed non-additive effects of litter mixing on nutrient dynamics: the presence of nutrient-rich species in mixture facilitated nutrient release, whereas nutrient-poor species facilitated nutrient retention. Fewer nutrients were released from mixtures containing high-quality litter, and more immobilized from mixtures containing low-quality litter, than predicted from monocultures, creating a difference in overall nutrient release between predicted and actual dynamics in litter mixtures. Nutrient release at the ecosystem-level was greatly overestimated when based on monocultures because the effect of species interactions on nutrient immobilization was not accounted for. Our data illustrate that the identity of species in mixtures is key to their role in non-additive interactions, with repercussions for mineral nutrient availability and storage. These results suggest that predictions of ecosystem-level nutrient dynamics using litter monoculture data likely do not accurately represent actual dynamics because the effects of litter species interactions are not incorporated.

AB 1. Predictable changes in the composition of macroinvertebrate communities in response to non-point source pollution are the basis of macroinvertebrate community indices. However, other factors, such as biotic interactions, also affect the composition of macroinvertebrate communities and may complicate the interpretation of such indices by interacting with abiotic stressors.
   2. The effect of agricultural pollutants on competition between two filter-feeding caddisflies, Brachycentrus appalachia and Hydropsyche spp. was studied in the laboratory using recirculating flow tanks.
   3. Experiments were conducted at two densities of Hydropsyche: high (300 per tank) and low (80 per tank). Brachycentrus density was kept constant at 40 per tank in all experiments. Experiments assessed the effect of an agricultural pollutant mix (sand, cow-manure compost mix) and the presence of the competitor on both taxa.
   4. The only negative response to pollutants was a larger number of Hydropsyche drifting in high-density tanks. In fact, at high densities, mortality of Hydropsyche was higher in controls than in tanks receiving pollutants.
   5. Hydropsyche and B. appalachia competed for resources and the presence of pollution did not affect the outcome of this competition. The presence of high densities of Hydropsyche resulted in higher drift and lower condition of B. appalachia. At low densities of Hydropsyche, B. appalachia larvae suffered greater mortality and tended to be in poorer condition. Brachycentrus appalachia may be less successful at even moderate densities of Hydropsyche due to competition between these taxa, most likely for prime feeding positions.
   6. Streams receiving non-point source pollution from agriculture may be able to support higher densities of Hydropsyche, which may further reduce the suitability of these habitats for B. appalachia.
   7. This experimental study suggests that competition may complicate interpretation of biotic indices, as changes in benthic invertebrate community structure normally ascribed to pollution may arise from intra-specific competition.

AB The complexity of ecological communities can often hinder understanding their structural features. With the recent application of network theory, the structure of previously neglected mutualistic communities has begun to be elucidated.
   Mutualistic communities have now been shown to follow particular power distributions in their degree, that is, the number of species interactions per species. However, predictive variables of degree and other structures of mutualistic networks remain largely unexplored.
   Here, we show that body size of ants is positively correlated with their degree in mutualistic networks comprised of ant interactions with extrafloral nectar (EFN) bearing plants in the Sonoran Desert. This pattern in body size and the number of plant species with which ants interact occurred among all eight sampled communities, a relationship which was not contingent upon phylogenetic history among ant species.
   These results indicate that further study of body size in ant-plant and other mutualistic networks may yield promising insights into the processes influencing their structure. Moreover, the degree-body size relationship for ant-plant mutualistic communities is consistent with that of predator-prey food webs, possibly suggesting similar underlying processes at work.

AB We analyzed the consequences of climate change and the increase in soil erosion, as well as their interaction on plant and soil properties in semiarid Mediterranean shrublands in Eastern Spain. Current models on drivers of biodiversity change predict an additive or synergistic interaction between drivers that will increase the negative effects of each one. We used a climatic gradient that reproduces the predicted climate changes in temperature and precipitation for the next 40 years of the wettest and coldest end of the gradient; we also compared flat areas with 20 degrees steep hillslopes. We found that plant species richness and plant cover are negatively affected by climate change and soil erosion, which in turn negatively affects soil resistance to erosion, nutrient content and water holding capacity. We also found that plant species diversity correlates weakly with plant cover but strongly with soil properties related to fertility, water holding capacity and resistance to erosion. Conversely, these soil properties correlate weaker with plant species cover. The joint effect of climate change and soil erosion on plant species richness and soil characteristics is antagonistic. That is, the absolute magnitude of change is smaller than the sum of both effects. However, there is no interaction between climate change and soil erosion on plant cover and their effects fit the additive model. The differences in the interaction model between plant cover and species richness supports the view that several soil properties are more linked to the effect that particular plant species have on soil processes than to the quantity and quality of the plant cover and biomass they support. Our findings suggest that plant species richness is a better indicator than plant cover of ecosystems services related with soil development and protection to erosion in semiarid Mediterranean climates.

AB We review the current state of research on vegetation heterogeneity in the Monte Desert at scales varying from landscape to intra-patch. Different factors are related to vegetation heterogeneity at every scale. At a coarse scale (i.e. landscapes and communities) vegetation heterogeneity is commonly determined by abiotic factors, whereas biotic interactions usually influence fine scale (patch, intrapatch) heterogeneity. Communities are distributed at the landscape scale according to differences in precipitation, topography and soil attributes. On the other hand, there is evidence that the spatial pattern of plant patches within communities is determined by runon -runoff processes, although biotic influences such as grazing can induce changes in the spatial pattern of patches when plant cover is strongly reduced. In the same way, at patch and intrapatch scales, biotic interactions (i.e. plant-plant interactions, grazing) determine the size and the species composition of plant patches as well as the distribution of species inside plant patches. However, the mechanisms operating behind such biotic interactions at small scales are commonly related to plant-induced changes in the physical environment. We also found evidence of cross-scale interactions, feedbacks, and non-linear effects such as those induced by grazing disturbance. Our analysis showed some regional differences in patterns and processes related to vegetation heterogeneity along the Monte Desert which can be ascribed to climatic and taxonomic variation among areas. Although information about vegetation heterogeneity and its causes and consequences in the Monte Desert is abundant, some areas where knowledge is scarce are detailed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB To quantify the interaction between climate and woodland continuity in determining the bioclimatic response of lichen epiphytes.
   Northern Britain (Scotland).
   Indicator-species analysis was used to pre-select lichen epiphytes along parallel gradients in climate and the extent of old-growth woodland. Nonparametric multiplicative regression was used to describe in a predictive model the individualistic response of selected species, which were projected based on climate-change scenarios and contrasting patterns of simulated woodland loss or gain. Species with a similar response were grouped using a novel application of cluster analysis to summarize the potentially huge number of projected outcomes. Projected patterns of occurrence under climate-change scenarios were examined for different levels of old-growth woodland extent.
   Forty-two lichen species were statistically significant indicator species in oceanic woodlands, and old-growth indicators under suboptimal climatic conditions. Responses to climate-change scenarios were contrasting, with one group comprising species projected to increase in extent in response to climate warming, and other response groups projected to decrease in occurrence, possibly in response to shifting rainfall patterns. The occurrence of all response groups had a positive relationship with old-growth woodland extent.
   An 'oceanic' biogeographical group of epiphytes identified using the baseline climatic and present-day woodland setting comprised species with a cyanobacterial photobiont or tropical phytogeographical affinities. However, within this group the individual species responses to climate-change scenarios were contrasting. Additionally, group responses may be poorly matched with simple ecological traits. However, the studied interaction between climate and habitat continuity suggests that the impact of climate change might be offset for certain lichen epiphytes by appropriate management of woodland resources, for example, expansion of native woodland around remnant old-growth stands.

AB With ecosystems increasingly supporting multiple invasive species, interactions among invaders could magnify or ameliorate the undesired consequences for native communities and ecosystems. We evaluated the individual and combined effects of rusty crayfish (Orconectes rusticus) and Chinese mystery snails [Bellamya (=Cipangopaludina) chinensis] on native snail communities (Physa, Helisoma and Lymnaea sp.) and ecosystem attributes (algal chlorophyll a and nutrient concentrations). Both invaders are widespread in the USA and commonly co-occur within northern temperate lakes, underscoring the importance of understanding their singular and joint effects. An outdoor mesocosm experiment revealed that while the two invaders had only weakly negative effects upon one another, both negatively affected the abundance and biomass of native snails, and their combined presence drove one native species to extinction and reduced a second by > 95%. Owing to its larger size and thicker shell, adult Bellamya were protected from crayfish attack relative to native species (especially Physa and Lymnaea), suggesting the co-occurrence of these invaders in nature could have elevated consequences for native communities. The per capita impacts of Orconectes (a snail predator) on native snails were substantially greater than those of Bellamya (a snail competitor). Crayfish predation also had a cascading effect by reducing native snail biomass, leading to increased periphyton growth. Bellamya, in contrast, reduced periphyton biomass, likely causing a reduction in growth by native lymnaeid snails. Bellamya also increased water column N:P ratio, possibly because of a low P excretion rate relative to native snail species. Together, these findings highlight the importance of understanding interactions among invasive species, which can have significant community- and ecosystem-level effects.

AB Recent studies have emphasized the role of positive interactions in ecological communities, but few have addressed how positive interactions are mediated by abiotic stress and biotic interactions. Here, I investigate the effect of a facilitator species on the abundance of macroalgae over a gradient of herbivory. Grazing by sea urchins can be intense on temperate reefs along the California coast, with benthic macroalgae growing exclusively in physical refuges and interspersed within colonies of the strawberry anemone, Corynactis californica. Field experiments indicated that the net effect of C. californica on turf algae was strongly nonlinear over a gradient in density of sea urchins. At low intensities of urchin grazing, the anemone and macroalgae competed for space, with algae capable of overgrowing C. californica. At intermediate grazing intensities, C. californica provided a refuge for turf algae but not for juvenile kelp. Neither turf algae nor kelp benefited from the presence of C. californica at the highest levels of grazing intensity, as sea urchins consumed nearly all macroalgae. The hump-shaped effect observed for C. californica contrasts with the prevailing view in ecological theory that positive interactions are more common in harsh environmental conditions. The results reported here qualify this view and underscore the need to evaluate positive interactions over a range of abiotic stress and consumer pressure.

AB We explored pairwise nearest-neighbour interactions in four species-rich shrubland plant communities, asking the question: how often is an individual of species j the nearest-neighbour of species i? In the observed data and null models, less than 35% of the maximum possible number of nearest-neighbour species pairs was present, and at three of the four sites the number of observed nearest-neighbour pairs were significantly less than those occurring in simulated null communities. Many of the missing pairs included woody shrubs whose absence might be interpreted as evidence of site-specific competition between larger growth forms for soil resources or space. Less than 5% of the pairs of species that occurred did so at frequencies different from that expected under random mixing, and many of these pairs were conspecific. Of the heterospecific pairs whose frequency differed significantly from random mixing there was a weak bias towards pairs occurring at higher rather than lower frequencies than expected. There was no evidence for asymmetry (interaction of species j with species i but not the reverse) in the frequency of species pairs. Nearest-neighbour relationships are species-specific rather than between plant functional types. The four sites form a soil nutrient and water availability gradient, and, according to the stress gradient hypothesis, positive species interactions should be most prevalent at the most stressful sites. However, we found the opposite: the site with the highest availability of resources had both proportionally the most heterospecific pairs, and the most conspecific and heterospecific species pairs with frequencies departing significantly from that expected under random mixing.

AB In both ecology and conservation, often a strong positive association is assumed between the diversity of plants as primary producers and that of animals, specifically primary consumers. Such a relationship has been observed at small spatial scales, and a begetting of diversity by diversity is expected under various scenarios of co-evolution and co-adaptation. But positive producer-consumer richness relationships may also arise from similar associations with past opportunities for diversification or contemporary environmental conditions, or from emerging properties of plant diversity such as vegetation complexity or productivity. Here we assess whether the producer-consumer richness relationship generalizes from plot to regional scale and provide a first global test of its strength for vascular plants and endothermic vertebrates. We find strong positive richness associations, but only limited congruence of the most diverse regions. The richness of both primary and higher-level consumers increases with plant richness at similar strength and rate. Environmental conditions emerge as much stronger predictors of consumer richness, and after accounting for environmental differences little variation is explained by plant diversity. We conclude that biotic interactions and strong local associations between plants and consumers only relatively weakly scale up to broad geographical scales and to functionally diverse taxa, for which environmental constraints on richness dominate.

Monitoring multispecies interactions and their environment is critical for analysis of community dynamics, multispecies habitat conservation plans and for adaptive ecosystem management programs. In this study, three simple methods (scaling exponent of Taylor's power law, resource exploitation competition and interspecies mean crowding coefficients) based on abundance were applied to estimate multiple tree species interactions along the Northeast China Transect. This transect was identified as a middle-latitude transect for terrestrial ecosystem studies by Global Change and Terrestrial Ecosystem Program of IGBP. Our analyses show the differences and similarities of these three methods because each one emphasizes different aspects of multispecies interaction measurement. The combined use of these three methods can provide an easy and simple way to estimate multispecies interactions based on abundance of each tree species and their change under environmental change. The suggested approach could help identify indicator species for monitoring, improve population viability analysis, and set priorities species conservation.

AB Facilitation of tree regeneration by nurse shrubs that offer protection against large herbivores is an important driver of wood-pasture dynamics. Here we asked whether the response to facilitation by nurse shrubs depends on the grazing resistance of the protege saplings. We experimentally tested the protective effects of the thorny Rosa rubiginosa on browsing frequency, survival, and biomass change of saplings of two species-groups, presumably differing in grazing resistance: the coniferous Abies alba and Picea abies and the deciduous Acer pseudoplatanus and Fagus sylvatica saplings. The saplings were planted under and outside (1.5 m) planted nurse shrubs, under zero, low and high grazing intensity. In total, 1920 young saplings were transplanted to 60 blocks and followed for I year. Although the number of saplings browsed did not differ between species-groups, the coniferous saplings showed lower resistance to cattle browsing (i.e. lower survival and growth rates) than the deciduous saplings. The less resistant coniferous saplings benefited significantly more from nurse shrubs than the more resistant deciduous species in terms of growth of the surviving saplings, but not in terms of overall survival. This was likely due to herbivory on the nurse shrubs causing incidental browsing on protege saplings and differences in biomass off-take. At high grazing intensity facilitative effects of the nurse shrubs decreased, especially for the coniferous species.
   These results have important management implications for the endangered wood-pastures in Western Europe. For a sustainable management and conservation that allows tree recruitment, grazing intensity should remain low to best promote facilitation processes for all tree species, but in particular for the less resistant conifer saplings.

AB Across large spatial scales, species richness in many taxa is mainly determined by climatic variables. However, some of the mechanisms behind large-scale patterns of species richness and abundance are expected to act on the community level, and on a smaller scale than the resolution of the data commonly used for deriving these patterns. We studied the distribution of sheetweb spiders (Araneae: Linyphiidae) across Europe using both standardised samples from local habitats and large-scale inventories. In the first approach, we analysed species and individual numbers from standardised pitfall traps from 17 locations distributed from northern Sweden to Spain and Greece. We also calculated Simpson indices to correct for different activity densities. Additionally, we analysed whether diversity of sheetweb spiders is sensitive to habitat type. In the second approach, we investigated the known sheetweb spider species richness of European countries and large islands. In both datasets, species richness of sheetweb spiders reached a maximum at about 55 degrees N and declined towards the Mediterranean and the Arctic. In addition, species richness decreased from western (maritime) to eastern (continental) regions. Also Simpson diversity showed a hump-shaped relation to latitude, and was the only variable influenced by habitat type. In contrast to species richness and diversity, activity density increased monotonously with latitude. Towards the north, sheetweb spiders are likely limited by energy availability, towards the south, water limitation as well as bottom-up and top-down community interactions may reduce sheetweb spiders. Accordingly, their diversity does not follow the pattern of vertebrates, large insects and aquatic organisms, which depend more strongly on energy availability. (C) 2009 Gesellschaft fur Okologie.

AB Inclusion of fundamental ecological interactions between carbon and nitrogen cycles in the land component of an atmosphere-ocean general circulation model (AOGCM) leads to decreased carbon uptake associated with CO2 fertilization, and increased carbon uptake associated with warming of the climate system. The balance of these two opposing effects is to reduce the fraction of anthropogenic CO2 predicted to be sequestered in land ecosystems. The primary mechanism responsible for increased land carbon storage under radiatively forced climate change is shown to be fertilization of plant growth by increased mineralization of nitrogen directly associated with increased decomposition of soil organic matter under a warming climate, which in this particular model results in a negative gain for the climate-carbon feedback. Estimates for the land and ocean sink fractions of recent anthropogenic emissions are individually within the range of observational estimates, but the combined land plus ocean sink fractions produce an airborne fraction which is too high compared to observations. This bias is likely due in part to an underestimation of the ocean sink fraction. Our results show a significant growth in the airborne fraction of anthropogenic CO2 emissions over the coming century, attributable in part to a steady decline in the ocean sink fraction. Comparison to experimental studies on the fate of radio-labeled nitrogen tracers in temperate forests indicates that the model representation of competition between plants and microbes for new mineral nitrogen resources is reasonable. Our results suggest a weaker dependence of net land carbon flux on soil moisture changes in tropical regions, and a stronger positive growth response to warming in those regions, than predicted by a similar AOGCM implemented without land carbon-nitrogen interactions. We expect that the between-model uncertainty in predictions of future atmospheric CO2 concentration and associated anthropogenic climate change will be reduced as additional climate models introduce carbon-nitrogen cycle interactions in their land components.

AB Agricultural landuse alters landscape pattern, with important consequences for native species. Complex responses to changes in landscape pattern may be observed for species with strong inter-specific relationships. We investigate how the abundance of an ecologically important food resource, the grey mistletoe (Amyema quandang), is influenced by the interactive influences of human-modified landscape pattern, bird disperser abundance and host condition. mistletoe abundance was estimated in brigalow (Acacia harpophylla) dominated remnants in three separate study areas with differing landscape patterns. Negative binomial generalised linear models of mistletoe abundance were tested with combinations of seven explanatory variables: study area, landscape connectivity and edge contrast, patch shape, bird disperser abundance, brigalow foliage cover and basal area of standing dead trees. Ranking of model averaged parameter estimates showed that study area, bird disperser abundance, patch shape, dead trees and connectivity had the strongest influence on A. quandang abundance. Mistletoe abundance apparently increased with landscape modification, particularly in narrow linear patches, but may be limited by the availability of seed dispersers and host condition. Given high landscape modification and ongoing degradation, management should be targeted towards maintaining brigalow remnant condition to ensure bird and mistletoe populations can be supported in the long-term.

AB Although density-edge effects are commonly reported, we have only scratched the surface in understanding the mechanisms underlying how habitat edges mediate species interactions. Here, I use a combination of field surveys and experiments to explore the linkages between the presence of host-plant edges (Scolochloa festucacea), the within-patch distribution of planthopper eggs (Delphacodes scolochloa), and the oviposition behavior of their egg parasitoids (Anagrus spp.). The field surveys revealed that densities of hosts and parasitoids at the edge were >= 2.5 times lower than densities in the patch interior and that the effect was independent of patch size. As a consequence of its edge-avoidance behavior, host within-patch dispersion was significantly more aggregated in the presence, as compared to the absence, of an edge. Also, as patch size decreased, the proportion of the patch that was core (i.e., beyond the influence of the edge) decreased, and the degree of host aggregation increased. In a subsequent field experiment, I found that the dispersion of hosts affected Anagrus oviposition behavior only when hosts were present on islands with discrete edges. Under these circumstances, the proportion parasitized and per capita parasitized were 2.3 and 3.4 times higher, respectively, when hosts were clumped as compared to when hosts were uniformly or randomly distributed. Based on a laboratory experiment using small S. festucacea patches, I found that Anagrus had 40% shorter step lengths, spent 52% more time in the patch, and parasitized 84% more hosts when hosts were clumped as compared to uniformly distributed. These results were indicative of area-restricted search by Anagrus, which is an effective foraging strategy when hosts are clumped. This is the first study to demonstrate that predator foraging behavior in response to prey dispersion can be mediated by the presence of a patch edge. Also, because edge-averse behavior is commonly reported in the literature, an underappreciated effect of fragmentation on predator-prey interactions and stability could arise from edge-mediated effects on prey within-patch aggregation.

AB The social and ecological systems of Mediterranean streams are intrinsically linked as a result of long human occupation. In this region, these links vary greatly across small distances due to geomorphology, resulting in great diversity across space, which poses particular challenges for understanding and managing these systems. This demands (i) interdisciplinary integration of knowledge that focuses on the social-ecological interactions, while according due consideration to the whole; and also (ii) transdisciplinary integration, integrating lay and expert knowledge to understand local specificities. To address these needs-a focus on interactions and local knowledge-the research presented here studies the human-nature relationship in Mediterranean streams. Its main objective is to improve understanding of Mediterranean streams, but it also provides practical inputs to enhance local-level management. The study adopts an applied approach from the perspective of natural resources management. A case study was developed conducting field work on streams within the Natura 2000 site of Monfurado, Portugal-a mainly privately owned area with conflicting land uses between conservation and farming. Rivers and streams in Portugal are considered to be in very bad condition, particularly with regard to water quality. The experimental design was based, from a critical realism perspective of inter- and trans-disciplinarity, on the complementarities between methodologies from (i) the social sciences: value survey and analysis of discourse; and (ii) the natural sciences: biomonitoring and integrity biotic indexes. Results characterized the connected systems from both ecological and social points of view. They also characterized the relationship between both dimensions. We concluded that well-established riparian vegetation cover of streams is a key structural element of the human-nature relationship in the Mediterranean streams of Monfurado at several levels. The central role this structure might have in the dialog between the conflicting land uses with regard to water management is discussed, and priority targets for management are identified. The tree stratum in streams may work as a conciliation factor in the conflict between farming and conservation, as it is in the interest of both sectors to maintain it; however, the shrub stratum is effectively a source of conflict between the two perspectives and needs further work at the social-change level.
